TI  - Positioning through epistemic cognition in higher education: conceptualising the 
      ways in which academics in a business school view heutagogy.

AB  - Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of 
      conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. 
      Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to 
      teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about 
      how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational 
      theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in 
      which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses 
      from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the 
      future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted 
      interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning 
      journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on 
      a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were 
      asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate 
      through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is 
      little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going 
      to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put 
      in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological 
      positioning. The paper conceptualises academics' positioning through a typology 
      of epistemic views.

TI  - A heutagogical approach for the assessment of Internet Communication Technology 
      (ICT) assignments in higher education.

AB  - Pedagogical foundations exist for incorporating technology in instruction; 
      however, these foundations have not kept pace with technology's evolution. 
      Through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), students now 
      can share content directed at external audiences, i.e., audiences other than the 
      instructor. These audiences are referred to as authentic audiences as they are 
      public-facing and exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers 
      evidence of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to 
      external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive pedagogical 
      rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences wherein the goals are 
      self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of heutagogy, the study of 
      self-determined learning, as an approach for assessing assignments that utilize 
      ICTs and are directed at authentic audiences. Finally, the authors offer an 
      approach for the assessment of these assignments, including a rubric.
