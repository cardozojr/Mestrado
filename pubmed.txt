TI  - Heutagogy: A self-determined learning approach for Midwifery Continuity of Care

AB  - AIM: The aim of this discussion paper is to discuss learning theories in 
      midwifery education, as related to the Midwifery Continuity of Care Experience 
      and to propose an original conceptual framework based on Heutagogy. BACKGROUND: 
      Midwifery education curricula include a number of midwifery practice experiences. 
      One of the requirements is for students to provide Midwifery Continuity of Care. 
      To achieve these experiences, students in Australia are required to provide care 
      to at least ten (10) women through pregnancy, be on call for the woman's birth 
      and provide at least two visits post-birth. Continuity of care experiences appear 
      to have been incorporated without sufficient consideration of the educational 
      purpose of the experience, or how the experiences contribute to the development 
      of the profession. Although we do know midwifery practice embraces woman-centred 
      care as its philosophical underpinning, a learning approach that is congruent 
      with this philosophy needs to be clearly articulated. DESIGN: A discussion paper 
      that compared and contrasted learning theories to align with Midwifery Continuity 
      of Care experiences. METHODS: A review of the literature on learning theories was 
      conducted before comparing and contrasting the theories to arrive at a conceptual 
      framework focused on learning theory and its application to the Midwifery 
      Continuity of Care Experience. RESULTS: Heutagogy provides a potentially 
      congruent educational learning approach to underpin the continuity of care 
      experiences, in comparison to traditional learning theories of pedagogy and 
      andragogy. With a paucity of research in the application of heutagogy to 
      midwifery education, it's conceptual underpinnings and the possible application 
      to the Continuity of Care Experience, this paper explores the possible 
      theoretical applications of heutagogy to midwifery education. CONCLUSION: As a 
      learning theory, heutagogy is well - aligned with woman-centred care. Heutagogy 
      provides a theoretical framework suitable to underpin strategies, including the 
      conceptual framework proposed, that may assist in empowering students to 
      participate in their own education by giving them the ability to be 
      self-determined in both their approach to learning and to evaluate their own 
      learning needs.

TI  - Positioning through epistemic cognition in higher education: conceptualising the 
      ways in which academics in a business school view heutagogy.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s10734-023-01048-2 [doi]
AB  - Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of 
      conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. 
      Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to 
      teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about 
      how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational 
      theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in 
      which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses 
      from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the 
      future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted 
      interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning 
      journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on 
      a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were 
      asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate 
      through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is 
      little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going 
      to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put 
      in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological 
      positioning. The paper conceptualises academics' positioning through a typology 
      of epistemic views.

AB  - The 'Learning Meta-Learning' dataset presented in this paper contains both 
      categorical and continuous data of adult learners for 7 meta-learning parameters: 
      age, gender, degree of illusion of competence, sleep duration, chronotype, 
      experience of the imposter phenomenon, and multiple intelligences. Convenience 
      sampling and Simple Random Sampling methods are used to structure the anonymous 
      online survey data collection voluntarily for LML dataset creation. The responses 
      from the 54 survey questionnaires contain raw data from 1021 current students 
      from 11 universities in Bangladesh. The entire dataset is stored in an excel file 
      and the entire questionnaire is accessible at (10.5281/zenodo.8112213) In this 
      article mean and standard deviation for the participant's baseline attributes are 
      given for scale parameters, and frequency and percentage are calculated for 
      categorical parameters. Academic curriculum, courses as well as professional 
      training materials can be reviewed and redesigned with a focus on the diversity 
      of learners. How the designed courses will be learned by learners along with how 
      they will be taught is a significant point for education in any discipline. As 
      the survey questionnaires are set for adult learners and only current university 
      students have participated in this survey, this dataset is appropriate for study 
      andragogy and heutagogy but not pedagogy.

TI  - Innovative pedagogical principles and technological tools capabilities for 
      immersive blended learning: a systematic literature review.
PG  - 1373-1425
LID - 10.1007/s10639-022-11243-w [doi]
AB  - Blended learning is widely known for its ability to improve learning, 
      nevertheless little is still known about the best ways of designing effective 
      blended learning environment which can support immersive learning such as greater 
      learning experience and accessibility to education. In this respect, this study 
      investigates the mapping of the principles of three Education 4.0 innovative 
      pedagogies, namely, heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy, with the capabilities of 
      three technological learning tools, that is, Facebook (FB), Learning Management 
      System (LMS), and Blog, via a systematic literature review technique. The 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines were used as the methodology, and the literature was further selected 
      using Gough's Weight of Evidence criteria, resulting in 59 studies. The results 
      show that cognitive factor is the most linked pedagogical principle to the four 
      main capabilities of technological learning tools, that is, time, self-related, 
      learning task, and learning community-related. This mapping is useful for 
      instructors to plan learning and teaching by choosing the technological learning 
      tools that match with appropriate Education 4.0 pedagogies for optimising the 
      immersive blended learning practices.

TI  - Is epistemic injustice a worthy application to mental health nurse education?
PG  - 1196-1204
LID - 10.1177/09697330241259154 [doi]
AB  - This paper explores the philosophical concept of epistemic injustice and contends 
      its significance and relevance to mental health nurse education and clinical 
      practice. The term epistemic injustice may be unfamiliar to mental health nurses, 
      yet the effects are readily visible in the dismissing, silencing, and doubting of 
      service users' knowledge, testimony, and interpretation. Existing professional 
      values and clinical standards lack depth and critical exploration pertaining to 
      epistemology and associated ethical concerns. Despite central tenets of 
      person-centred care and valuing the service users' voice, epistemic injustice 
      continues to occur. Epistemic injustice cannot be summed up merely by asking 
      nurses to listen to service users. This represents an oversimplification of 
      epistemology, ignoring the complexities of social influence and knowledge 
      exchanges. Epistemic injustice brings something new and innovative to the nursing 
      curriculum and fits within the principles of heutagogy. It encourages deep 
      reflexivity surrounding the ethical issues of power inequalities and 
      intersectionality. Inclusion in mental health nursing education allows for the 
      social and political powers of psychiatric diagnosis as a form of silencing and 
      stigma to be examined. Practical application is made to mental health nursing 
      education and practice with epistemological values and ethical reflexive prompts. 
      These can be utilised by educators and lecturers for pre-registration mental 
      health nurse education, post-registration, and continued professional 
      development.

      they may not learn in the typical fragmented care system. However, exactly what 
      skills and knowledge they are expected to 'learn' and how these can be assessed 
      have never been specifically identified. AIM: To explore midwifery students' 
      continuity of care learning experiences within pre-registration midwifery 
      education. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with first, second and third year 
      Bachelor of Midwifery students (n = 12), who were undertaking CoCE in rural and 
      regional tertiary hospitals in NSW, Australia. FINDINGS: The overarching theme, 
      'Learning through relationships', was made up of three interrelated themes: 
      Meeting women and making connections, Being known, and Understanding holistic 
      care. DISCUSSION: The findings from this study contribute to understanding the 
      educational effects of CoCE. The CoCE relationship provided safety and freedom to 
      learn which was seen as foundational for midwifery students' vision of their 
      future practice and can be seen as a self-determined transformational approach to 
      learning. CONCLUSION: This study adds insight into midwifery students' experience 
      of CoCE, and demonstrates that transformative learning occurs through developing 
      a relationship with both the woman and the midwife. For midwifery to develop as a 
      profession and maintain its focus on woman-centredness, it is important that this 
      aspect of midwifery education remains embedded within midwifery program 
      philosophies and learning outcomes.
