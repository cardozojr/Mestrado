	abstract = {This study looks to identify an assessment design construct that overcomes known issues in authentic assessment design practices in digital education. These include lack of "freedom-of-choice", lack of focus on multimodal nature of the digital process, and shortage of effective feedbacks. This study proposes an authentic assessment, that combines gamification (G) with heutagogy (H) and multimodality (M) of assessments, building upon learning analytics (A), known as GHMA. Proposed assessment design is a skills-oriented game-based assessment approach. Learners can determine their own goals and create individualized multimodal artefacts; receive cognitive challenge through cognitively complex tasks structured in gamified non-linear learning paths; while reflecting on personal growth through personalized feedback derived from learning analytics. This pilot research looked to: (i) establish validity of all key elements within the assessment design through structural equation modelling, and (ii) identify if application of assessment design leads to improved learner satisfaction based on differences-in-differences estimation using hierarchical linear regression. Results validated all key elements of GHMA assessment model, as beneficial factors tied to positive learner satisfaction on assessment delivery. There existed statistically significant positive post- and pre-treatment differences between the experimental and control group satisfaction survey scores, which indicated positive receptivity of proposed assessment design.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of neurodivergent learners attend higher education. This necessitates examination of best-fit learning models to successfully support the current generation of college students. While pedagogy and andragogy have historical relevance, in isolation, they may lack alignment with the individualization embedded in neurodiversity-affirming practice. This study conceptualized a novel learning framework for neurodivergent college students through the lens of neurodiversity-affirming practice. Via constant comparative qualitative analysis of American university faculty interviews and framework juxtaposition, three themes were identified: pedagogy vs. andragogy, self-determination, and interdependency. Thematic analysis revealed uncertainty regarding best-fit learning framework, with consensus reached regarding complexity of serving neurodivergent adults in post-secondary settings. An innovative framework titled “Building a Heutagogical Bridge” was envisioned, describing the role of heutagogy, student-centered, self-determined learning, in connecting signature pedagogical and andragogical approaches. This study revealed the potentiality of implementing and assessing approaches to skillfully incorporate heutagogical, pedagogical, and andragogical principles in higher education settings. The perspectives of faculty from the USA within this study can inform neurodiversity-affirming practice in American universities, while providing implications for future study and practice in international college settings, where contexts, needs, and culture may differ. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2023.},

	abstract = {Blended learning is widely known for its ability to improve learning, nevertheless little is still known about the best ways of designing effective blended learning environment which can support immersive learning such as greater learning experience and accessibility to education. In this respect, this study investigates the mapping of the principles of three Education 4.0 innovative pedagogies, namely, heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy, with the capabilities of three technological learning tools, that is, Facebook (FB), Learning Management System (LMS), and Blog, via a systematic literature review technique. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used as the methodology, and the literature was further selected using Gough’s Weight of Evidence criteria, resulting in 59 studies. The results show that cognitive factor is the most linked pedagogical principle to the four main capabilities of technological learning tools, that is, time, self-related, learning task, and learning community-related. This mapping is useful for instructors to plan learning and teaching by choosing the technological learning tools that match with appropriate Education 4.0 pedagogies for optimising the immersive blended learning practices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We interviewed 31 professionals to explore ID/ETs’ attitudes towards lifelong learning, motivation for seeking learning opportunities, and learning approaches. The Constant Comparative Method for Naturalistic Inquiry was used to analyze the transcripts. As predicted by heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, participants demonstrated traits of capable learners who view learning as part of their job and use a range of approaches to plan and continuously reflect on their learning. We recommend that employers promote self-determined learning practices within their organization, and that educators prepare students to be self-determined learners. We further recommend that academia, practitioners, and students contribute to repositories of resources and examples to learn from each other. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845 post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of instructors does not inherently affect students’ affective engagement. The study revealed that learners’ affective engagement is affected by distinct combinations of the instructor’s facial and paraverbal expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners’ affective engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic radically disrupted face-to-face teaching of practice-skills within social work programs in many countries. Across the globe, campuses closed suddenly, meaning students and staff had to quickly transition to online platforms to sustain teaching and learning interactions. In response to this unprecedented and demanding situation and from the perception of the inquirers, this article documents the critical pedagogical and heutagogical factors associated with teaching practice-skills online, during the current challenging and destabilising epoch. Co-operative Inquiry is used to critically reflect on the ‘hard’ technological applications and engagements experienced by social work academics, and learning and teaching technologists from a university, who urgently developed and delivered intensives online during this complex time. The thematic analysis identifies four pedagogical and heutagogical factors vital for educating during such a time. These are: responsiveness, collective leadership, dynamic interaction between staff and students, and critical reflection. The implication being, that these factors can become solid foundations for transformational online learning in dynamic teaching environments. The article provides a timely empirically-based examination of the delivery of skill-based intensives online during a challenging and destabilising period, the associated teaching processes, and the technological affordances. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background: Social media is a ubiquitous phenomenon that serves as a tool for communication, collaboration, and creativity. In the long term, it has an indispensable place in the field of education. The research paper discusses the use of certain social networking sites where learning management systems are extensively and consistently used in the teaching and learning process at universities. The rapid transition to online platforms had a tremendous impact on the educational process, exposing and promoting the effectiveness of heutagogy. The circumstances made it necessary to emphasize the value of self-directed learning and the capacity to identify educational requirements and strategies for reaching study objectives. This kind of research corresponds to the increased need to develop desired self-study skills in students. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how undergraduate students perceive the trends in acceptance and the degree of appropriateness of social media for academic purposes. Methods: Research on social media use in education was inspired by a review of the literature. The purpose of the questionnaire is to track awareness, use, general satisfaction, communication, testing, and revision. The set of social media examined in the survey (years 2021 and 2022) was modified to reflect the social media landscape at the time. This study compares the findings of four different studies. The outcomes are displayed in graphs. Results: Two areas are analyzed: social media as a means of communication in the process of education and social media as a tool enabling students’ revision and testing of study materials. The first two studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the same set of examined social media and fit the comparison, enabling to define the trend in students’ perceived satisfaction with social media for study purposes. The third and fourth studies discussed in this paper were run during the winter semesters of 2021 and 2022. Conclusions: The most significant differences between 2021 and 2022 can be seen in Instagram, Twitch, and other platforms, where a substantial drop in satisfaction in the communication field can be seen. The biggest difference in revision and testing is found in Facebook, Twitch, and Teams, which are abandoning online teaching and learning after the COVID-19 event. Social media use for studying has significantly decreased, with noteworthy decreases in Wiki, Facebook, and video calls. © 2023 by the authors.},

This research study aims to investigate the application of heutagogical design principles such as exploration, creation, collaboration, connection, reflection, and knowledge sharing. Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to identify and analyze the potential use of heutagogical design principles across a variety of online instructional approaches, including personalized learning, peer learning, smart learning, self-regulated learning, independent learning, learner-centered learning, facilitative learning, collaborative learning, free-choice learning, and lifelong learning within the theoretical framework of heutagogy. The results revealed that the most frequent instructional approaches included collaboration, self-regulation, personalization, and lifelong learning. Thus, instructional approaches encouraged students to connect with peers and instructors within the facilitative learning environment. As a result, instructors developed students’ 21st century skills in the scope of engaging, meaningful, and experiential learning environments. Online teaching and learning in higher education might be diversified based on heutagogical principles and instructional approaches and their subsequent implementation in the context of higher education. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {TVET in Malaysia is geared toward providing quality education, training, and resources but it still needs to be strengthened and reformed toward producing a more quality and skilled workforce. This study aimed to procure feedback from TVET curriculum key-players’ (automotive) on the integration of automotive case-based simulation (CBS) as TVET future learning strategies. Collective case-study research design was used with purposive sampling design which involved 5 curriculum key-players in vocational college and 16 automotive industries as study respondents. A set of questionnaires and interview protocols were used to gather quantitative and qualitative data. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to obtain an average measure agreement among raters. ATLAS.ti was also used through thematic analysis to produce models. The ICC showed high values of agreement for the process and structure of the CBS. The limitation of this research focused on one program (automotive technology) through the key-players’ and industries’ perspectives toward the implementation of CBS as a tool to enhance students’ soft skills. The collation of both data showed the alignment between both parties against the CBS. The curriculum key-players agreed that CBS fulfilled its requirements as a tool to enrich TVET students’ marketability skills, supported by the automotive industries’ perspective which believed that using CBS would prepare TVET students’ readiness to the workplace. Notably, the CBS provides an opportunity to stimulate thinking and learning preferences among students, in addition to being a learning tool for future TVET learning strategies that connect theory and practice in preparation for job training. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this discussion paper is to discuss learning theories in midwifery education, as related to the Midwifery Continuity of Care Experience and to propose an original conceptual framework based on Heutagogy. Background: Midwifery education curricula include a number of midwifery practice experiences. One of the requirements is for students to provide Midwifery Continuity of Care. To achieve these experiences, students in Australia are required to provide care to at least ten (10) women through pregnancy, be on call for the woman's birth and provide at least two visits post-birth. Continuity of care experiences appear to have been incorporated without sufficient consideration of the educational purpose of the experience, or how the experiences contribute to the development of the profession. Although we do know midwifery practice embraces woman-centred care as its philosophical underpinning, a learning approach that is congruent with this philosophy needs to be clearly articulated. Design: A discussion paper that compared and contrasted learning theories to align with Midwifery Continuity of Care experiences. Methods: A review of the literature on learning theories was conducted before comparing and contrasting the theories to arrive at a conceptual framework focused on learning theory and its application to the Midwifery Continuity of Care Experience. Results: Heutagogy provides a potentially congruent educational learning approach to underpin the continuity of care experiences, in comparison to traditional learning theories of pedagogy and andragogy. With a paucity of research in the application of heutagogy to midwifery education, it's conceptual underpinnings and the possible application to the Continuity of Care Experience, this paper explores the possible theoretical applications of heutagogy to midwifery education. Conclusion: As a learning theory, heutagogy is well - aligned with woman-centred care. Heutagogy provides a theoretical framework suitable to underpin strategies, including the conceptual framework proposed, that may assist in empowering students to participate in their own education by giving them the ability to be self-determined in both their approach to learning and to evaluate their own learning needs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Teaching and learning in computer application courses are being improved by educators as technology continues to change the face of education. For the purpose to promote student participation and self-directed learning, this study investigates how the heutagogical online learning paradigm might be adapted to computer application instructions. The Heutagogy Online Learning Model (HeuLEM) is a model that this research proposes based on heutagogy principles, including the six design elements of heutagogy. It enables learners to take control of their educational process, make knowledgeable choices, and develop critical skills for the digital age. Incorporating self-determined learning, reflection, strong interpersonal skills, and collaborative online tools, instructors can design an engaging and dynamic online learning environment that fosters students' digital collaboration abilities. HeuLeM comprises the theoretical underpinnings of heutagogy and offers helpful implementation tactics for the model in computer application courses. This study is to identify whether the six heutagogy design elements can be adapted to Heutagogy Online Learning Model to enhance the digital collaboration skills of students. A total of 12 experts were selected to analyze the fuzziness consensus of experts. All of the data obtained will be analyzed using the Fuzzy Delphi method. The findings show that all the heutagogy design elements are suitable to be adapted Heutagogy Online Learning Model to enhance the digital collaboration skills of students. The six heutagogy elements that explore, create, connect, share, reflect, and collaborate have reached unity with the threshold value of d ≤ 0.2 and the percentage of the expert group is more than 75%. Therefore, based on the consensus agreements, the development of Heutagogy Online Learning Model for enhancing the digital collaboration skills of students should be incorporated with the elements of heutagogy. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.},

I reveal the challenging experience of introducing the Team Academy Module due to the institutional conflicts between pedagogy and heutagogy in entrepreneurship education. I proposed a hybrid approach, which creates a local learning environment in which pedagogical and heutagogical practices co-immerse and are more effective to overcome the conventional constraints of entrepreneurship education to implement Team Academy approaches. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Berrbizne Urzelai and Elinor Vettraino; individual chapters, the contributors.

Conducting a mixed-methods study, we investigate meeting points between heutagogy principles and BL in the context of curricular change in the academic timetable of teacher education college, where pre-COVID most courses have been taught face-to-face (F2F). At present, teacher educators and students meet F2F for three weeks, followed by a week of remote learning, combining synchronous and asynchronous pedagogies. Data have been collected by a closed-ended questionnaire and two focus groups, involving altogether 76 lecturers and 553 students. Findings indicate that heutagogy has been applied in all facets of BL, rather than only with online or digital technological components. This study explores a bottom-up growth of heutagogy expressions in BL at three meeting points. When the core facets of heutagogy principles have been identified, there has been a predominance of the students’ agency and life-long learners, together with facets such as a non-linear learning and capability development that have been underrepresented. This study contributes to the research field of heutagogy in teacher education as it identifies the meaning and the way a structural change in the curriculum can constitute an accelerator and catalyst when implementing heutagogy in practice. © 2023 by the authors.},

Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self-determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical-professional education. The study’s objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = –2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean (M = 25.36) than men (M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy. © 2024 The Author(s).},

The findings revealed that heutagogical activities had mediating effect on postgraduates’ self-determined learning. These are new insights on self-determined learning as no studies have examined the mediating effect of heutagogical activities through structural equation modelling analysis. Overall, this study offers valuable contributions to the empirical evidence and body of literature on heutagogy by providing an extended understanding of the mediating role of heutagogical activities in postgraduates’ self-determined learning.

	abstract = {Smart technology, artificial intelligence and robotics have recently become the focus of the new industrial revolution, which now influences our daily lives. The process of teaching and learning at higher education institutions needs to be updated to meet the challenges of Industry 4.0. Different types of learning spaces and pedagogies, such as heutagogy, are required. Although heutagogy has been practised for a long time, there is a deficiency in studies which review the existing literature about implementing heutagogy. In light of this fact, this article is, therefore, a systematic review of the literature on the application of heutagogical methods in universities worldwide. This study utilized publications from 2016 to 2020 from databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, ACM Library, Science Direct, Emerald Insight, Taylors & Francis Online, as well as from the alternative database Google Scholar. The search efforts resulted in a total of 23 articles that can be systematically analyzed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). By using ATLAS. ti 8 as a tool, this review has five main themes, namely, i) ICT; ii) Blended Learning; iii) Outside Classroom Activities; iv) Distance Learning and; v) Module or Curriculum Related. The results showed that heutagogy is a suitable approach that can be applied in this era and that it is recommended that this approach be implemented during this COVID-19 season. Finally, at the end of this research, a number of recommendations for future scholars will be discussed.  © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.},

	abstract = {This chapter draws upon the experiences of building an authentic collaboration between a University team of academics and students with a hospital design lab and healthcare practitioners to solve real world problems that the hospital stakeholders were ill-equipped to tackle. The collaboration was founded through establishing a like-minded community of practice built upon mutual trust, and the formation of a transdisciplinary design team. The STUDIO602 project demonstrated the mutual benefits of authentic collaboration between industry and higher education. Universities have expertise in supervising and mentoring student research teams to solve real-world problems. By building authentic collaboration between university research teams and hospital design teams innovative solutions to practical health care problems can be solved. Such collaborative design partnerships will lead to better health outcomes for society as innovative solutions to pre-hospital care, out-patient care, and innovative design of hospital infrastructure and technology-enhanced practices are developed. Extending these collaborations to international teams working remotely together we can widen the impact of the developments beyond New Zealand, and bring into the design team international expertise as well. We discuss the application of several techniques used in the software industry and how they relate to the STUDIO602 project—these include design thinking, team management, stakeholder engagement and rapid prototyping techniques. The innovation we are illustrating in this chapter through this project example are the development of pedagogical design principles to facilitate authentic collaboration between student design teams and industry. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

	abstract = {One of the strategies to improve teachers' skills and professionalism is the practice of continuous professional development. To fulfill the demands of students and learning in the 21st century, teachers must have a strong foundation and knowledge of ongoing professional development. However, a-business-as-usual continuous professional development does not contribute to any significant improvements for teachers of junior high school in Pematangsiantar. The objective of this research was to develop a management model for teachers’ continuous development. This is carried out through competency-based training with a heutagogy approach. A development model called ADDIE, which stands for Analysis, Design, Develop, Implementation, and Evaluation was used to develop the management model. The subject of this research was 80 junior high school students in Pematangsiantar. They were divided into 30 and 50 people for the limited trial and the broad trial, respectively. Questionnaires were distributed as the instrument of data collection. The data was then analyzed using a statistical descriptive analysis technique. The research found that the effectiveness of the competency-based training management model was measured by the N-Gain score, in which the G-value was 0.79 and 0.82 for limited trial and broad trial, respectively, which was in the high category. The results of the assessment of the effectiveness of the model obtained an average value of 94%, which was in the "very good" category. The effectiveness of the training program was assessed from the aspects of reactions, learning, behavior, and results, and the results show that the assessment of the classroom action research training program obtained an average score of 92%, or a very good category, which means that the classroom action research training program is very effective in improving teachers’ competence. The significance of this model has been proven to give an innovative solution to teachers’ continuous professional development. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.

	abstract = {The SOAR model' (as it has come to be used in the UK and abroad) is in effect a conceptual metamodel that scaffolds pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy in its design and delivery of response-able, equitable, and empowering learning for all students. SOAR invokes personally meaningful interconnections within and between the dimensions of self, opportunity, aspirations, and results through inbuilt requirements for self-reflection, action and interaction, research, analysis, and synthesis. It is inclusive while it values diversity, and its practical methodology enables all learners to become response-able while developing employability and sustainability for effective functioning in the diverse contexts of learning, work, and life in a changing, challenging world. This chapter shows how SOAR integrates and implements an 'inside-out' systemic approach that teachers can adapt to deliver several key and currently siloed strategic agendas under one umbrella, thereby encompassing the much broader agenda of response-able transformational education that is sorely needed in contemporary times. © 2023 by IGI Global.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore a gendered perspective on how learners' intrinsic psychological motivators: valence, technology-innovativeness, self-development and self-efficacy as well as extrinsic social and institutional motivators, such as social norms and management commitment, collectively influence learners' behavioral intention to adopt asynchronous EdTech tools such as MOOCs. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was developed by integrating insights from social cognitive theory (SCT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). Data were collected from 622 Indian college students across different academic levels who had enrolled in at least one MOOC. Data analysis was performed using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). The bootstrapping method using IBM AMOS 23.0 software was adopted further for moderation analysis. Findings: The study found that while intrinsic drivers were positively associated with behavioral intention, extrinsic drivers had a limited influence. The results of the moderation analysis showed that gender significantly influenced the relationship between self-development and perceived usefulness as well as the relationship between valence and perceived usefulness. Our study’s findings represent a significant contribution to theoretical advancements, indicating a notable shift in students' learning emphasis from social interactions to self-directed approaches. These results align closely with the principles of connectivism within the heutagogy theory framework, underscoring learners' responsibility in shaping their learning journey. Practical implications: Our study findings hold significant practical implications for future applications. Based on our study’s findings on the positive impact of self-development and self-efficacy, it is crucial to offer structured and interactive learning options for guided experiences. Integrating digital skills training into MOOC curricula can enhance engagement across diverse learner levels, given the significant predictive power of technology innovativeness. Furthermore, emphasizing the benefits of MOOC certifications, such as career advancement or academic recognition, can increase their appeal and perceived value, considering the significance of “valence” as an influential factor. Originality/value: Asynchronous EdTech tools, notably MOOCs, have emerged as potent catalysts for social change, providing unparalleled accessibility, flexibility and avenues for lifelong learning. Our study pioneers an investigation into the impact of valence and technology innovativeness on learners' perceptions, significantly influencing their willingness to adopt MOOCs positively. By exploring nuanced sociological dynamics across diverse societies, our research underscores the necessity of customizing EdTech solutions to encompass diverse gender perspectives. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The proposed E-Module is expected to make the lectures more engaging and effective for students. A product design and development approach was employed in this study to collect data from 15 respondents, comprising five experts and ten lecturers from the Southern Zone Community College. The usability of the E-Module in terms of interface design, interaction, content, and heutagogy learning approach was assessed through expert evaluation forms and user questionnaires. Resultantly, the usability evaluation of this EModule revealed a high degree of agreement in terms of interface design, interaction, and content. Respondents also agreed that utilizing the heutagogy learning approach is incredibly relevant and may improve lecturers' teaching sessions. Nevertheless, larger-scale research is needed to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of this E-Module of heutagogy learning approach in enhancing students' knowledge and competencies, particularly in the Measurement Tools Course. © 2024 IEEE.},

This study aimed to provide an overview of the dimensions of TDC, the level of TDC, obstacles, and solutions to improve teachers' digital competence. Data were collected through Sinta, Emerald, Elsavier, Wiley, IEEE, Taylor & Francis, ERIC, JSTOR Journals, MDPI, and Springer. From these, 47 articles were investigated to address the focus of this research issue. The results show that the dimension of TDC widely used was the DigCompEdu 2.0 framework from the European Commission. Based on TDCs’ classification using teacher competence as stated in Indonesia’s Law No. 14 of 2005, previous researchers tended to discuss the dimensions of TDC which focused on professional competence (46.67%), pedagogic competence (29.33%), social competence (12%), and personality competence (16%). Furthermore, teachers' average digital competence is still low. So, collaboration between the government and the school and organizing teacher training is needed to improve teacher digital competence. This study also revealed that heutagogy and synchronous collaborative learning models could be used to enhance TDC in the 21st century. © 2023 Published by the ISTES Organization},

However, how coaches do this has yet to receive much attention. This investigation draws on a thematic analysis of 10 semistructured interviews that followed coaching sessions with an explicit focus on developing independence. Three themes emerged: developing a cognitive performer, an attuned coaching process that fosters independence, and developing the individual’s capacity to learn. The findings suggest that learners have an explicit comprehension of the “what and why” of the performance and coaches develop the learner’s ability to learn both how and where to continue their development postcoaching. The coaches achieve these two objectives by developing a long-term independent performance in their coaching practice. Coaches are not trying to develop fully independent performances during coaching, but instead to prepare learners to continue their development with adaptable performances within the practicalities of learning in adventurous environments. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Midwifery curricula in Australia incorporate ‘Continuity of care experiences’ (CoCE) as an educational strategy based on an assumption that midwifery students will learn skills and knowledge about woman-centred care that they may not learn in the typical fragmented care system. However, exactly what skills and knowledge they are expected to ‘learn’ and how these can be assessed have never been specifically identified. Aim: To explore midwifery students’ continuity of care learning experiences within pre-registration midwifery education. Methods: Focus groups were conducted with first, second and third year Bachelor of Midwifery students (n = 12), who were undertaking CoCE in rural and regional tertiary hospitals in NSW, Australia. Findings: The overarching theme, ‘Learning through relationships’, was made up of three interrelated themes: Meeting women and making connections, Being known, and Understanding holistic care. Discussion: The findings from this study contribute to understanding the educational effects of CoCE. The CoCE relationship provided safety and freedom to learn which was seen as foundational for midwifery students’ vision of their future practice and can be seen as a self-determined transformational approach to learning. Conclusion: This study adds insight into midwifery students’ experience of CoCE, and demonstrates that transformative learning occurs through developing a relationship with both the woman and the midwife. For midwifery to develop as a profession and maintain its focus on woman-centredness, it is important that this aspect of midwifery education remains embedded within midwifery program philosophies and learning outcomes. © 2022 Australian College of Midwives},

Given the emergence of online/remote coaching and coach development (ORC/CD) in recent years, this could involve the exploration of frameworks and onto-epistemologies that better ensure alignment with contemporary understandings of learning in the digital era. In the current article, we take the opportunity to explore some of the possible theoretical considerations that can inform future research in this emerging area; and thus support the application of technology-enhanced coaching/learning in sport coaching contexts. First, we philosophically position our arguments within a ‘new culture of learning’ (NCOL) – a framework that is congruent with online learning experiences. From there, we consider Connectivism – as an expression of New Materialism – as a suitable onto-epistemology to guide future research given its recognition of networked ways of being in the twenty-first century. We conclude by suggesting heutagogy (self-determined learning) as an appropriate signature ‘∼gogy’ for ORC/CD environments. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Personalisation plays a vital role in the engagement of adult learners in online learning environments. Historically, research has focused on applying adaptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, without integrating those technologies within teaching and learning approaches. Academagogy is a teaching and learning approach that allows an educator to select appropriate parts from the models pedagogy (educator-centred), andragogy (learner-centred), and heutagogy (learner-driven) for better learning outcomes. Previous studies used academagogy in face-to-face learning contexts; however, academagogy’s application has been limited in online learning contexts. This paper presents our interim observations of applying academagogy to an online Information Technology course. Using mixed methods to analyse learner self-reflections, online learning analytics, learner grades, learner surveys, and learner interviews, we observed that learners progressed along the PAH continuum towards andragogy and heutagogy, with some exceptions. The exceptions were found where learners regressed on the PAH continuum when they encountered problems. The exceptions provide insights into the problem areas that block learner engagement and achievement, laying a foundation for future work in personalising the online learning experience. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Heutagogy, or the study of self-determined learning, has been rapidly gaining interest within the field of education as a response to the market demand for creative and competent employees who can adapt quickly to continuously changing, complex workplace environments. Heutagogy, which can be viewed as extension of pedagogy and andragogy, is based on the principles of human agency (learner-centeredness), capability, self-reflection and metacognition (double-loop learning or learning to learn), and nonlinear teaching and learning. When combined with today’s technology, heutagogy offers a holistic framework for teaching and learning that supports development of self-determined, autonomous learners and provides a basis for creating holistic, learner-centered education environments. This chapter describes heutagogy, its principles, elements, and theoretical basis, as well as provides a review of the research and applications of heutagogy within different educational levels, from grade school to lifelong learning. In addition, the chapter gives guidance for instructors who want to design for heutagogy in the classroom and provides examples for integrating technological tools that support self-determined learning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

Purpose: This study is proposed to deepen the understanding of how teachers perceive science clubs, what learning they obtain from them, and what factors contribute to promoting this learning. Sample: Five experienced science teachers involved in coordinating school science clubs participated in the study. They were all experienced science teachers with some experience in running a science club. Design and methods: The study may most accurately be described as a descriptive-qualitative study with a comprehensive scope. Data was obtained through semi-structured interviews. The collected information was analysed from a descriptive and interpretative perspective using techniques specific to content analysis. Results: The results show that teachers value science clubs as an opportunity to enhance both their content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, a space to reconsider what it means to be a science teacher, to get to know and connect more with their students, and to collaborate with other colleagues. Conclusion: It is concluded that the study provides evidence that the learning acquired in science club activities complements and expands the interviewed teachers' expertise and contributes to their professional development in all three dimensions: personal, social, and professional. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The use of peeragogy, heutagogy, and cybergogy may engage students in the learning processes in which active learning plays a key role. This study aimed to examine the effect of the implementation of the Merdeka Curriculum on active learning practices and their relationships with hybrid activities based on hybrid learning approaches, and active learning counterparts of (1) self-regulated learning: (2) self-directed learning, and (3) self-determined learning. These relationships will be examined in Indonesian curriculum implementation in which student-centered principles are emphasized. A cross-sectional survey was conducted by collecting responses of vocational high school students on survey. The digital questionnaire was sent to 600 Indonesian students, of whom 555 completed it. The relationships among the constructs were examined using a structural equation modeling. The results showed that a curriculum emphasizing student-centered principles was fully mediated by active learning and hybrid activities to promote student self-regulated learning (SRL), self-determined learning (SDET), and self-directed learning (SDL). Active learning and hybrid activities directly affect students’ SRL, SDET, and SDL, Three counterparts of active learning that form important parts of long-life learning. This model indicates that Indonesian curriculum implementation may encourage active learning and indirectly increase learner engagement, autonomy, and metacognitive development. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {This article shows how the self-determined learning environment in Paths, an innovative teacher-education (TE) program, enables students to experience meaningful learning which reinforces their mental wellbeing and resilience. According to the self-determination theory (SDT), a central goal of such a learning environment is to support students' three basic emotional and social needs of self-capacity, autonomy, and relatedness and connections with others. While the Paths program trains the students to be high-school teachers, and coaches them to be mentors for youth at risk (YAR), about half of these students define themselves as having been YAR who suffered from a low level of resilience and mental wellbeing in their adolescence. Using the self-determined learning environment, Paths fosters students as self-determined learners in many courses which use methods like Project-Based Learning (PBL), Self-Determined Learning (Heutagogy), Outdoor Training (ODT), and Self-Management Learning (SML). In keeping with the qualitative multiple-case study method, semi-structured interviews with four Paths graduates and examples of other graduates' learning presentations demonstrated that graduates’ learning experiences supported their emotional and social needs and strengthened their feelings of resilience and mental wellbeing during and after the learning. The graduates testified that this learning environment helped them to become entrepreneurs and empowering educators, as well as social and environmental activists. These findings reveal the productive contribution of the self-determined learning environment to students' development as teachers and YAR mentors, and as social and environmental leaders. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The present day school system curtails children’s natural growth and interferes with their freedom to explore. It is here that teachers have an opportunity to engage meaningfully with the student community, and make them and society aware of the importance to explore and become self-determined and autonomous learners. Sustained engagement of students in an online class is only possible with continuous efforts from teachers. Constructivist Digital Learning Heutagogy could be the effective solution to break the monotony in online classes, and also to break away from teacher-centric classes and to bring about constructive engagement among the learners in online classes. Online education has very much changed the needs of education. Today we need an education system which is self-driven and facilitated by a teacher or a more knowledgeable other. The study throws light on CDLH (Constructivist Digital Learning Heutagogy) Model. Four-week training (how to teach with the use of the CDLH Model) was given to TGT mathematics teachers and then an intervention at six months will be provided by the same mathematics teachers to their students to assess the psychological indicators like Positive Emotions (Expression, Emotion Management, Expressing Gratitude), Academic Achievement (Focus and Persistence), Learning Engagement (Love of Learning) and Positive Relationship (Peer Relationships and Empathy) taught by the CDLH Model. CDLH model has been validated and tested for reliability (PLS SEM software) in the pilot test conducted. Results revealed that learning through constructivist Digital Learning Heutagogy supported academic achievement, learning engagement and positive emotions, whereas it also showed that the peer relationship was not supported by the intervention. Very importantly it helped to break the monotony of the class. © 2022, Commonwealth of Learning. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Community of Inquiry (CoI) has increased in popularity in almost 25 years due to its adaptability which has spanned from asynchronous text-based environments up to a wide range of different settings. The CoI identifies the mutual interaction of three dimensions named presences. The survey to detect the perception of presences is a Likert-scale survey based on 34 items arranged in 10 subscales which are assigned as follows: 4 to teaching presence, 3 to social presence, and 3 to cognitive presence. Several studies identified alternative arrangements of the main components as a result of EFA and CFA. Consequently, the exploration of alternative settings keeps on revealing variations in the way presences interact with each other. The ongoing debate about whether to add a fourth dimension, specifically learning presence, has produced numerous publications but no definitive revised version of the survey. This study suggests an extension of the classical survey by incorporating a supplementary set of 12 items related to learning presence inspired by the theory of heutagogy (or self-determined learning). The sample for the experimental four-dimensional CoI framework comprised 55 university students. The analysis investigated the internal correlations of this extended survey, revealing positive expectations and opportunities for further adaptations. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Mobile learning is well established in literature and practice, but under-evolved from a rigorous learning design perspective. Activity theory presents a sophisticated way of mapping and understanding learning design, but for mobile learning this does not always translate into change in practice. The reported research addresses this by coupling a mobile learning specific approach to activity theory with a practice-based framework: the design for transformative mobile learning framework mapped to the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum matrix (the DTML-PAH Matrix). Seven case studies are analysed using this approach and presented narratively along with framework informed analysis. Findings include that the DTML-PAH Matrix can be used to provide clearer implications and guidance for mobile learning practice, and that the DTML-PAH Matrix can also be guided by the practice over time. Implications for further research and practice are discussed. Implications for practice or policy: • Provide technological and pedagogical scaffolds to students. • Learning designs should focus upon enabling elements of learner agency and creativity. • To develop learning solutions to real world problems utilise a design-based research approach. • Create authentic collaborative learning activities and tasks. • Integrate mobile learning affordances in the design of the course and curriculum. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

	abstract = {This study investigates the implementation levels of Heutagogy, Peeragogy, and Cybergogy approaches among instructors at vocational colleges in Malaysia. Employing a quantitative survey research design, data were collected from a sample of 241 instructors across 15 vocational colleges, representing various Technology fields such as Automotive, Electrical, Electronic, Construction, Welding, Industrial Machining, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning, and Computer Systems & Network Technology. The sample was selected using a cluster stratified convenient sampling method. Demographic information, including gender, age, race, institutional zone, vocational college, program, experience, qualification, certificate, and class, was gathered. A structured questionnaire comprising 53 items served as the primary data collection instrument. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software to derive frequency values, percentages, mean scores, and standard deviations. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed to identify differences in the implementation of Heutagogy, Peeragogy, and Cybergogy approaches among the instructors. The findings indicate a high level of implementation for Heutagogy and Peeragogy approaches, while the Cybergogy approach is practiced at a moderate level. Significant differences were observed in the implementation of these approaches based on the instructors’ fields and teaching experience. To enhance the practice of Cybergogy, it is recommended that vocational college administrations provide training workshops or courses to improve the teaching skills of their academic staff for 21st century learning environment. © 2024, Penerbit UTHM.

	abstract = {Introduction: The needs of today’s higher education have changed and higher education does not need a one-way communication from teacher to student but rather learn to appreciate the new role of the teacher as a facilitator with mutual responsibilities toward the creation of knowledge. Heutagogy, which emphasizes learner autonomy and the creation of self-determined learners, has garnered attention as a potential solution to address the evolving needs of teacher preparation. However, empirical research on the beliefs and attitudes of Heutagogy within the teacher education context remains limited. This study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of lecturers and pre-service teachers of the School of Education and Life-Long Learning (SoELL) at SDD-UBIDS. Methods: Convergent mixed method design with both quantitative and qualitative data analysis, the study collected both quantitative and qualitative data on 513 Pre-service teachers and 30 Lecturers from SoELL, SDD-UBIDS using a four-point Likert scale questionnaire and interview. Results: The findings revealed diverse perspectives among Lecturers and Pre-service Teachers regarding Heutagogy, with varying levels of understanding, acceptance, and readiness for implementation. Lecturers expressed enthusiasm for Heutagogy’s potential to foster learner autonomy and critical thinking skills, while pre-service teachers demonstrated varying levels of readiness and comfort with self-directed learning approaches. Discussion: Lecturers and Pre-service teachers expressed willingness to embrace a self-determined approach in which the learner reflects on what is learned and how it is learned and where the Lecturers teach the learners how to learn by themselves. The cognitive conflict and the inadequacy of pre-service teachers’ preparedness will necessitate a shift in their attitudes toward developing autonomy skills to effectively navigate the challenges of the 21st-century knowledge economy.

	abstract = {Students in higher education are using mobile devices, which challenges our understanding of what it means to learn in modern environments. By using mobile devices as instruc-tional aids, students gain a variety of social, cognitive, and technical abilities. Mobile devices may therefore be seen as supporting the growth of employability skills and broader lifelong learning, both of which may be helpful in a variety of circumstances. The quickly evolving landscape of technology and education presented teachers with a number of challenges, and they had to retrain and refresh their skills in order to provide practical training. As a result, heutagogical methods are ideal for enhancing their collective knowledge and skills. Online and blended learning (BL) offer a learning environment that incorporates technological affordances to facilitate learning. This enables the growth of an independent, capable, and self-directed lifelong learner. Heutagogy provides an educational strategy in this context that may link the development of lifelong learning competencies with BL and online learning environments. Using this methodology, we investigate the potential contribution of online and blended higher education to technology-enabled lifelong learning where heutagogical experiences are available. The results support the notion that heutagogy and lifelong learning are linked by some basic concepts that apply to both mixed and online learning environments. © 2024 by the authors of this article.},

The objective of the review was to gain a clear picture of recent developments in mobile learning frameworks to provide an understanding of current directions in mobile learning pedagogy. Eighteen peer-reviewed journal articles that presented new mobile learning pedagogical frameworks were examined and evaluated based on the characteristics of each framework. The two main areas of analysis were the pedagogical approaches integrated into the frameworks and their definitions of mobile learning. We conclude that mobile learning frameworks have become more diverse over time, in many cases tending to focus on specific aspects of mobile learning rather than attempting to address overarching concepts. With respect to pedagogies and their underlying theories of learning, social constructivism, heutagogy, collaborative learning, experiential learning, inquiry-based learning, and student-centred learning were mentioned most frequently. However, although many frameworks make reference to pedagogy, there is limited analysis of how mobile learning pedagogy might be defined as distinct from other contexts of learning. The key characteristics of mobile learning, consistent through most of the reviewed frameworks, comprise the portability of mobile devices across multiple contexts, connectivity, and accessibility, as well as learner-centredness (including personalisation and self-regulation). One key aspect of identifying the uniqueness and future potential of mobile learning is the special affordances addressed by mobile learning theory. We conclude that this is an area where further research is required. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one technology that promises more personalized responsive learning experiences, which learners often demand, and business schools struggle to offer, due to large cohort sizes and limited resources. This chapter outlines how AI can be used in ME to provide such personalized responsive learning experience. It considers the changing roles and opportunities for co-deployment of management educators and technology and explores how AI may support ME delivery formats and align with relevant teaching philosophies. Specific aspects dealt with in the chapter include the role of learning formats and facilitators, the contributions of the management educators and AI management educators (AIMEs), and the collaborative relationship between learners, management educators, and AIMEs. The chapter concludes that personalized responsive learning can be achieved by utilizing AI in collaboration with management educators and learners. We offer suggestions for implementation including how management educators can utilize different teaching philosophies (pedagogy, andragogy, heutagogy) to meet the needs of individual learners in a variety of ME contexts. © Chinnapong and 2022 selection and editorial matter, Martin R.

	abstract = {Reading is often viewed as the foundation of all learning including postgraduate study. It is common for most institutions of higher learning to assume that postgraduate students come equipped with the basic competencies of literacy and the required academic reading skills. Nevertheless, studies have shown that some international students for whom English is a foreign language (EFL) face several challenges in academic reading skills. This study examined how the academic reading skills of a group of postgraduate students can be enhanced through a six-month treatment program referred to as the PAH (Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy) Continuum which emphasized a methodology that shifted from full dependence to negotiated learning and independence. The study employed a quasiexperimental research design and involved an intact group of 50 postgraduate students studying in a private university in Malaysia, where English is the medium of instruction. Data were collected through pre and post reading comprehension tests, questionnaires and five focus group interviews. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, whilst qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings showed that the six-month PAH-Continuum Training Programme enhanced the learners’ academic reading skills and gave them the confidence to do well in their postgraduate studies. The findings also implied that the PAH-Continuum Training programme can be utilized as a viable teaching and learning framework to help adult mature postgraduate learners develop basic competencies in postgraduate study. © (2023), (UiTM Press).

	abstract = {This study aims to describe the didactic design of Indonesian online learning based on a heutagogical approach. The research design used is a qualitative research design using the Design-Based Research (DBR) method. The research subjects were students, lecturers, and learning experts. The data collection methods used were observation and interview and data analysis techniques with four stages of analysis. The results showed that the didactic design consisted of the stages of preparation and implementation of learning. The learning preparation stage is carried out by providing scaffolding consisting of seven stages, namely (1) essential study analysis, (2) precondition, (3) orientation and discussion, (4) topic determination, (5) assessment discussion, (6) technical discussion, learning, and (7) reflection. Meanwhile, the stages of learning implementation consisted of four stages, namely (1) exploration, (2) connection and reflection, (3) material comprehension, and (4) final reflection of learning. The design provides support for the concepts of learning agents, efficacy and ability, metacognition and reflection, nonlinear learning, and learning how to learn. © 2022, North American Business Press.

Following identification of the complex global crisis context, the first half of the chapter provides an overview of the three approaches-including complementarities arising from possible lacunae in each-as well as reviewing the major interests of their educational discourses; it then explores their joint contribution to education through the transversal lenses of philosophy of knowledge, andragogy/heutagogy, and normativity. The second half of the chapter potentializes the type of contribution such approaches can make to higher education theory and philosophy by advancing a yet deeper transversal engagement, one inspired by a complex interpretation of Boyer’s ‘scholarship of integration’; the engagement involves a matrix of: identity, relationality, and contextuality-in relation to: content of education, processes of education and systems of education. Calling upon such thinkers as Aurobindo, Buber, Gebser, Schumacher, Tarnas, and Davis, topics include: accountability, culture wars, currere, developmental levels, dialectics, ecological crisis, eco-logics, ethics, homo economicus, modern atomism, multiple intelligences, pertinence, planetary consciousness, poetics, postformal thinking, reconstructive postmodernism, schooling, systems thinking, transdisciplinarity, and worldviews. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Nicholas Hedlund and Sean Esbjörn-Hargens; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {Education in its essential meaning should beget a civilized and socio-emotionally intelligent, competent mindset in its stakeholders. However, this seems an ideal situation which is impractical owing to several conditions and constraints that impede the implementation of holistic education. Pedagogical practices initially relied on rote learning and thereafter several reforms in educational policies asserted the importance of nurturing global competency among the learners. However, this shift from rote learning to a more self-directed learning is a challenging transformation which is idealized to a great extent. In this article, we argue that a sudden shift may not be possible, and to realize learner autonomy and their self-directedness, there should be a gradual but steady progress from pedagogy to andragogy and then to heutagogy. Self-directedness and learner-centredness are the crucial aspects of heutagogy. Taking examples from a case study that we conducted with teachers of English from select higher education institutions in India, we analysed the various tenets of heutagogy and its practicality in the Indian context. We investigated how teachers are incorporating aspects of heutagogy in their English classrooms and what major challenges are encountered. Their individual classroom episodes may serve as an initial reservoir of ideas to orient further research in the field. The possibility of embedding the PAH continuum in classrooms is analysed through the lens of socio-constructivist theory. The insights from this study will be valuable for teachers and students who wish to gain a deeper insight into the heutagogical learning paradigm and its integration into language teaching in the classroom. © 2024 The Kerala State Higher Education Council.},

ODL provides an opportunity for many to study while working or raising a family. Nevertheless, ODL programs are associated with low student engagement and high non-completion rates compared to traditional programs. Among the main contributing factors are communication and course design, which relate to the level of responsiveness of instructors and the quality of course design thus delivery through online. An innovative approach is needed to address these issues, and heutagogy seems to be a viable alternative. Nevertheless, the heutagogical approach alone is incomplete without considering the instructional scaffolding technique that can affect adult students’ engagement. This study introduces a model that combines heutagogy and instructional scaffolding (HEIS) as a guideline in conducting a fully online ODL course called Technology and Media Design. It interrogates the impact of the course design from the perspective of postgraduate students and instructors in one of Malaysia’s public universities. Recommendations include for faculties with ODL courses to continuously help develop instructors’ competencies and using more suitable assessment approaches e.g., project-based.

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution has brought about significant changes in various fields including the education sector. It is increasingly essential for individuals, particularly student teachers, to embrace lifelong learning and acquire the know-how and skills required to grow into autonomous and critical thinkers. In this paper, we examine the virtual “air campus” experiences of 39 first-year student teachers of mathematics at a rural university in South Africa’s Eastern Cape Province. The heutagogical approach served as a lens for trainee teachers’ virtual “air campus” explorations. An exploratory qualitative case study design was employed to provide answers to two main questions that guided the inquiry. Findings of the study show that trainee teachers had varied experiences regarding what they learned from their virtual “air campus” visits. These include what constitutes effective teaching and how students learn as well as correction of common misconceptions regarding specific concepts in school mathematics. Through virtual lesson observations on the “air campus” of their choice, trainee teachers were also able to create their professional identities in terms of their future goals, ideal teacher traits, and desired teaching and learning environments. These findings demonstrate that integrating virtual learning environments into teacher education curricula and assessment has practical implications for enhancing trainee teachers’ self-directed learning, critical thinking, and professional identity development. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

Such is the bifurcation between executive education and professional practice that it has been described as a ‘valley of death’. Albeit dramatic in tone, this view of executive education points to the need for radical change in the way Business Schools conceive and deliver the curriculum. Hitherto, EE has been characterised by a pedagogy based on the functional delineation of learning to cohorts of students through standardised programmes. In recent times, Business Schools have adopted andragogical approaches as they look to empower students to exercise greater control over their learning- but is this sufficient? Heutagogy offers a view of learning that is centred on the self-determination of how individuals learn and that is embedded in authentic and life-long learning. This substantive review offers a view of future executive education through the theorisation of how a heutagogic approach may inform future curriculum developments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Formative assessments of the heutagogy approach are traditional (objective and essay tests) and outcome-based (such as developmental portfolios, the analytic rubric, and the perception rubric). Both assessments could provide personalized feedback, but they differ in response start, learning domain, speed of assessment results, focus, and execution time. Using a heutagogy approach, the design research results in an ontology schema, which is made up of learning resources and formative assessments.

	abstract = {Field education globally, has been highly disrupted by restrictions associated with COVID-19. This disruption has forced many students to engage with online learning. The current article presents a student-led co-operative inquiry exploring the experience of four social work students undertaking a remote research-based placement in regional Australia during a global pandemic. In this inquiry students’ critically self-reflected on the strengths and challenges of remote research-based placements. Despite some initial reservations, the students’ experience was positive overall. This article reports on four key themes that emerged from this inquiry: the translation of social work communication and relationship-building skills to online environments, the development of professional identity in a remote research-based placement, access to supervision in a remote context, and reflection on the experience of completing a research placement guided by the social work value of respect for persons. We conclude that undertaking a remote research placement helped forge students’ appreciation for the role of research in social work, enhanced their communication and research skills, and strengthened students’ sense of professional identity. These findings confirm remote research-based placements can offer relevant and effective placement opportunities that can inform social work field-education heutagogy as we move beyond the restrictions associated with the pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Sustainability has become an ever-increasing issue in today’s world. Countries across the world have had to refocus on sustainability due to the new pressures of climate change. In recent decades, numerous different institutions have become the architectural framework for the promotion and implementation of sustainability in society, namely: governments, non-government organizations, universities, social enterprises, and the private sector. One of the key drivers of sustainability is social enterprise education. This driver has become vital in higher education, as it enables the learner to understand the complex processes of sustainability. This chapter critically explores the interlocking relationship of social enterprise and sustainability. The authors of this chapter present findings from their UKIERI research project entitled “The Benefits of Modifying Social Enterprise within Higher Education’s Social Sciences Curriculum.” Moreover, the authors argue that social enterprise can have a real influence in the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were set out by the United Nations in 2015. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Utilizing video games as a means to ensure students are active participants whilst learning complex theoretical paradigms has proven highly beneficial, aiding in the reduction of attainment gaps and wider barriers to learning. So too, the approach has enabled cohorts to disentangle criminological problems whilst being empowered to question the nature of public criminology within contemporary discourse.

The purpose of this article is to address the research question: Based on our experience as educators, what TAL methods can support social work and human services curriculum delivery in an online environment? Using the co-operative research method and analyzing our reflections, we proposed a model of curriculum delivery which conceptualizes the application of four methods of TAL (pedagogy, andragogy, heutagogy, and paragogy). We also illustrate how this teaching approach can promote different levels of learning (single, double, and triple- loop learning). The model is based on internationally agreed principles of social work and can incorporate non-Western and Indigenous learning processes. We argue that when educators and learners use these four methods in different combinations, it is possible to produce learning experiences that augment social work skills and knowledge development, as well as prepare learners for a multi-dimensional world of change. The implication is that there is scope in the presented model to promote transformational learning and ways of positive engagement during social disruption and dynamic change, both features in our current global environment. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice. We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this offers opportunities for ‘teachable moments’ (Newell et al, 2023) and gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them, and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

This study was anchored on two theories, namely, the digital divide by Lloyd Morrisett and heutagogy by Kenyon and Hase. The major research findings were that ECD teachers faced challenges such as a shortage of infrastructure, severe power cuts, poor internet connectivity, a skill gap, and poor support from management, resulting in delays in learning for the majority of learners. This study recommended that there is a need for all stakeholders, including the government, to increase technical support, training of teachers in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), funding for infrastructure, the provision of gadgets, and improving power supply. © 2023 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

A construct validity and reliability are two important concepts in survey research that are used to assess the quality of survey items. This study was conducted to generate on the construct validity process of the survey items in heutagogy elements specifically for vocational learning. Items have been developed based on relevant literature and the context of vocational education in particular leads to readiness for employment. Therefore, to go through the process of validity and reliability of the items, this study involved 100 students from Vocational Colleges to response the survey items. There are 71 items in a set of questionnaires with six elements consists of Exploring, Collaborating, Relationship, Creating, Reflection and Sharing. The data was analysed based on Rasch Model as statistical measurement model that can be used to assess the validity and reliability of research instruments. The construct validity was examined by analysing the point-measure correlation index, infit, and outfit values; meanwhile, the reliability was examined by analysing the item reliability index. The results have shown that the findings of the analysis found seven items dropped because the items did not meet the requirements of the established analysis. By analysing the data collected from the questionnaire, the final instrument shows a total of 64 items suitable for measuring six elements of heutagogy. The Rasch Model differs from other measurement models in reliability assessment by focusing on one-dimensionality, assessing both person and item reliability, enabling item calibration, and providing fit statistics. Hence, this systematic approach may facilitate researcher to improve the items to produce the good quality of research instrument. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

This piece builds upon the principles of Critical Pedagogy and, reading them through a Frankfurt School of Critical Theory lens, combines them with tenets of heutagogy. There is no articulation of a how-to approach to criticality. At this juncture in the historical development of LD, the context deems that learning developers must negotiate the need to continuously articulate their worth, whilst resisting falling foul of undertaking their roles in an instrumental manner. Instead, enacting an ALDinHE ethos means that learning developers could transmute fear, and critically reflect upon what they, as well as fellow staff and students, are often encultured to do in the name of effective practice and outcomes. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Alicja Syska and Carina Buckley; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {As indicated in previous chapters, the dynamics of research investigating how to improve teaching requires us to investigate applied research within specific and distinct contexts. This is necessary to position research findings in relation to their clinical and/or professional situations, and derive value-adding insights capable of having an authentic, ‘real-world’ impact on practice. This chapter reports on research using heutagogy to promote self-determined learning (SDL) in relation to teacher training, using this research to promote online teacher professional learning (oTPL) in support of teaching improvement within an online learning environment. A key question for this chapter is whether or not online teaching and learning is able to be as efficacious as more traditional forms of teaching and learning, which tend to occur within a face-to-face (f2f) instructional context. Subordinate to this are further questions involving the relationship between oTPL and the purpose and form of research intended to investigate its efficacy; for example, which type of research best suits the particular situation and what model of online learning might be appropriate? We begin by focusing on why educators need to understand the importance of online teaching and learning. This has to do with understanding the impact technology has had on education in general, as well as the degree to which other factors, such as the use of school lockdowns as a measure to help control the covid pandemic, have also influenced our need to develop online teaching and learning skills as part of modern educational practice. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

Current research aims to investigate the student experiences with the andragogy approach and its potential impact on students' self-regulated learning. Andragogy, heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy principles used by the teacher as part of distance learning during the pandemic will be modelled to check their effect on the student's self-regulated learning. The results show that andragogy, heutagogy, cybergogy, and peeragogy have significant effects on self-regulated learning. Andragogy is proven to be based on heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy since it has a strong effect on these 3 approaches. The least path coefficient among them is shown by the path between andragogy and cybergogy. Andragogy also has a significant indirect effect on self-regulated learning through the approaches. The results may lead to a conclusion that andragogy, heutagogy, cybergogy, and peeragogy can be used as an effective way to improve the student self-regulated learning. © 2023 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

The challenges faced by the next generation of the nation are getting bigger; this is also felt by internship teachers (teacher training) who carry out school field introduction programs from universities. Seeing the low output to be able to get the opportunity to become a teacher with a bachelor's degree in education is the main concern of inequitable global civilization. The aim of the research is to focus on knowing the needs of internship teachers related to digital competence training before they carry out the school field introduction program. The research method used is a mixed method with a total of 160 active students at Brawijaya University who will become internship teachers. The results of the study reveal that the need for the aspect of gaining new competencies is 85%, the development of digital competencies is very high, especially in the aspect of integrating digital pedagogy, and the knowledge aspect is 65% for increasing heutagogy-based e-training experiences. This study concludes that the need for internship teachers for the existence of heutagogy-based e-training is very much needed to realize an equitable global civilization in the era of digital transformation. © 2024, Penerbit UTHM.

We start with the observation that the advent of the digital transformation of our society bridges the gap between industry and academia and provides many opportunities for the future by expanding learning experiences. This change has been undeniable since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, the success of apprenticeship training (Cerdin and Peretti in The success of apprenticeships, 2020; Montargot and Drillon in Succ Apprentice Views Stakeholders Train Learn 3:79–86, 2020) shows a growing interest in blended learning (Dziuban et al. in Int J Educ Technol High Educ 15:1–16, 2018) and ‘mixed processes and practices’ (Parsons and MacCallum in Agile and lean concepts for teaching and learning. Springer, 2019) on the part of companies and universities. Based upon three lecturers’ experiences in France, this chapter provides practical insights about how to align industry-based practices and higher education by focusing on three specific methods/approaches: ‘learning-by-doing’ through workshops, ‘project-based learning’ by means of case studies, and ‘heutagogy’ via mixed modes. Our aim is to highlight key challenges and barriers, advantages and opportunities of these three different approaches, and to suggest recommendations to support further development of innovative digital teaching and learning practices in higher education. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

The chapter explores the relationship between heutagogy (self-directed learning) and outdoor learning. Through interviews with former students, it considers how the diversity and intensity of experiences in the outdoors can be incorporated into formal structures of study in ways that support self-determined learning. The evaluation draws on long experience of leading a distance-learning programme in outdoor education and identifies tensions between academic structures (and norms) and the expectations of learners. In response, the work presents ways that the design of postgraduate study can support learners to develop an advanced understanding of their field and the skills of critical reflection. The chapter argues that the concept of heutagogy provides a strong pedagogic rationale for postgraduate study in its recognition of the agency of the learner, and that the formal structures of postgraduate study can be used to scaffold and validate the learners’ explorations of the liminal spaces between personal experience in the outdoors and academic theory. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {A review of the contemporary Australian church reveals a spiritual malaise in which passive learning has become the main staple for many church members or attendees. This sense is heightened by demographic trends over the last fifty years that reflect a sustained decline in Australians identifying as religious. Although commitment to Christianity is seemingly softening, this sociodemographic picture is contraindicated by other research that reflects a growing hunger for spirituality among many Australians. Given this disparity, there is an opportunity to re-examine pertinent understandings of spiritual growth. In the literature, notions of spiritual growth are conceptualised by a variety of definitions and operationalised by a range of tools and practices. Analysis suggests that many models are limited by linearity, passivity, and reductionism and do not adequately resonate with the complexities inherent in spiritual growth. This literature review extends previous research by examining the state of the art in relation to spiritual growth. The paper converges around the synthesis that heutagogy and coaching are effective twin strategies that may direct self-determined learning towards enhanced spiritual growth. This paper conceptualises opportunities for future research and thereby lays the foundation for an important emergent research agenda.

The term epistemic injustice may be unfamiliar to mental health nurses, yet the effects are readily visible in the dismissing, silencing, and doubting of service users’ knowledge, testimony, and interpretation. Existing professional values and clinical standards lack depth and critical exploration pertaining to epistemology and associated ethical concerns. Despite central tenets of person-centred care and valuing the service users’ voice, epistemic injustice continues to occur. Epistemic injustice cannot be summed up merely by asking nurses to listen to service users. This represents an oversimplification of epistemology, ignoring the complexities of social influence and knowledge exchanges. Epistemic injustice brings something new and innovative to the nursing curriculum and fits within the principles of heutagogy. It encourages deep reflexivity surrounding the ethical issues of power inequalities and intersectionality. Inclusion in mental health nursing education allows for the social and political powers of psychiatric diagnosis as a form of silencing and stigma to be examined. Practical application is made to mental health nursing education and practice with epistemological values and ethical reflexive prompts. These can be utilised by educators and lecturers for pre-registration mental health nurse education, post-registration, and continued professional development. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Drawing upon the results from multiple bibliometric analyses, the study explores publication productivity specifically in relation to the PAH continuum. This study revealed that distance education, learning, teaching, professional development, and lifelong learning have been the most prominent research areas within the PAH continuum. Within that, related topics were identified, including online learning, mobile learning, e-learning, and educational technology. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Around 25 years ago, some researchers argued for moving towards innovative learning models characterised by being more personalised and where the students would have a more active role in deciding what to learn, when to learn and how to learn. Nowadays, there is a need for a flexible, efficient, universal and lifelong education. Lifelong learning is fully integrated into our society and, from the student point of view, it is very different from regular learning. Among these differences there is the maturity of students, the fact that the domains of interest are much broader, the way how learning occurs at different depths, the fact that the topics to study may be related to work, family and leisure, and that students have little availability due to their necessity to conciliate home, work, leisure and learning. Lifelong learning requires personalised models that adapt to students’ needs and constraints, but lifelong learners keep suffering from models that are adapted neither to their necessities, nor to the needs of society. This paper reflects on the actual situation of lifelong learning, analyses some of the relevant literature and discusses the challenges to conceptualise, from a transdisciplinary point of view, innovative e-learning models that promote self-determination of students.

This goal is achieved by using students' voices documented in open-ended interviews and is underpinned by the conceptual framework of heutagogy. The aim is to shed light on students' perceptions on school effectiveness in supporting their needs through successful participation and agentic possibilities. Findings showed that students were more prone to social rejection and being isolated or bullied than their peers. They were struggling to feel included or participate, their needs were only partially being met, and they had few opportunities to exert influence on their educational trajectories. Recommendations are provided to assist educators and schools in enhancing students with SEN to connect to the learning process and community, with the provision of appropriate learning adjustments and more active approaches to ensure their acceptance by mainstream students, including the formation of coaching peers to assist in developing social and academic skills under teacher's scaffolding practices. This study highlights the contribution of the heutagogical perspective to advance research on the participation and agency of students with SEN in mainstream schools. © 2022 National Association for Special Educational Needs.},

	abstract = {Relevance. The digital transformation of education has necessitated a shift towards heutagogical principles in postgraduate programs. Even before the pandemic, theories about digital natives and heutagogy pointed towards new directions in education driven by digitalization. Purpose. This study aims to synthesize the emerging paradigms of Education 3.0 and 4.0 in relation to knowledge management concepts for training master's students. It also evaluates students' perspectives on the principles of Education 3.0 and self-directed learning. Methodology. A questionnaire with two sections was administered to 149 master's students across four universities in Kazakhstan. Results. Understanding heutagogy as a self-determined learning theory can cultivate a new generation of professionals ready for the knowledge economy. Heutagogy nurtures this phenomenon of a globalized knowledge marketplace. The theoretical portion summarizes approaches to redefining learning and learner identities by connecting digital disruptions to transformations in learning and thinking. Conclusions. The practical component examines Master's students' evaluations of heutagogical principles. Future plans include developing Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on heutagogy and Education 4.0.

	abstract = {In the post-pandemic era, lifelong learning (LLL) emerged as the key to professional development and the core competency of all disciplines. Even globally, there is a dearth of evidence based bibliometric analysis, notably on LLL. This study addresses this gap by examining the data retrieved from the Elsevier Scopus database. A systematic search method was adopted to retrieve 1806 publications from 790 journals from 1963 to 2022. The R package, Biblioshiny, was used for data analysis, including productivity/performance analysis, citation analysis, and collaboration network analysis of social structure. The findings showed that the number of publications has significantly increased over time. A large number of studies were published in 2022. Overall, 85 countries contributed to LLL. Among them, the United States was the most productive with 787 publications, and the United Kingdom was the country with 4731 citations. Learning was the trending topic, and skill development was an emerging theme in LLL. The results will aid the stakeholders in identifying largely unexplored areas of research that need more attention and funding. This study outlines not only the current scientific developments but also the potential future of LLL research. This study will also be used as a resource for researchers and teachers in LLL. Future research directions in this area of knowledge are also outlined. © 2024 Phcog.Net. All rights reserved.},

However, online learning is often seen as a mode of delivery that will work for any distance education institution in any context. The increased relevance of online learning during and after the COVID-19 pandemic has further exaggerated the adoption of online learning, which requires ongoing research on the actual use of online learning, and this study responds to this need. Therefore, this study aimed to determine how online learning is used in an open distance learning (ODL) context. A case study on the implementation of online learning was conducted at an ODL university in South Africa. Data were collected through open-ended questionnaires, interviews, and non-participant online observation. Participants were purposefully selected academics from various colleges in the university. Findings reveal that awareness of educational choices in the online environment appeared to be neglected. Based on the findings, the study presents a framework for online learning in ODL. It is built on the concept of awareness, and we argue that the integration of online learning should be carefully curated and planned with intentional institutional, lecturer, and student awareness. The principles of the theories of transactional distance, the community of inquiry, social constructivism and heutagogy should guide the operationalisation of each type of awareness presented in the framework. © 2024 The Author(s).},

Educators need to rethink existing teaching approaches to better prepare learners for future careers that Industry 4.0 will create. The World Economic Forum defined a new education model, called Education 4.0, which contains eight major changes to redefine learning in the new economy. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is an approach that promotes critical thinking, social-emotional skills, and life-long learning. These skills are necessary for Education 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to recommend the principles of heutagogy as an effective teaching and learning approach to meet the needs of Education 4.0. The approach of the study examines existing literature on Education 4.0 and heutagogy. A conceptual model that interconnects heutagogy to the four learning principles of Education 4.0 will be offered as a key finding to answer the research question: How does heutagogy in higher online education meet the needs of Education 4.0?

	abstract = {Nearly all educational institutions use learning management systems (LMS). Post-pandemic figures suggest that the uptake of LMS is about 98%. This means that most educators, especially those in post-schooling education, will use, and be responsible for designing, an online course site. While there is a tendency to use course sites as a repository and convenient communication medium, there is an unmet need to design these sites in a way that facilitates learning. As online teaching and learning become more prolific, especially in higher education and adult learning contexts, it is increasingly necessary to design course sites that facilitate learning as opposed to course sites that are just repositories. Just like the approaches that a teacher uses in classroom teaching, the teacher's underpinning philosophy will impact the way they will design their course sites on an LMS or website. Despite technology and online being present for over two decades, course design and teaching in the online environment remains trapped in traditional behaviorist and content-driven approaches. © 2023, IGI Global.

In exploring this topic, the qualitative research methodology, interpretive paradigm, and rhizomatic approach were used. Participants and documents were purposefully sampled. Data was ethically collected through documentation and semi-structured telephonic interviews. The data were thematically analysed and processed to find patterns, keywords were identified, coded, and clustered into categories, and themes emerged. Qualitative findings showed that EE studentteachers knew about OER informally and some students wanted to use OER. Hindrances to OER usage by student-teachers included little engagement with OER by lecturers and costs to access OER. © 2022, Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {There are known issues in authentic assessment design practices in digital education, which include the lack of freedom-of-choice, lack of focus on the multimodal nature of the digital process, and shortage of effective feedbacks. This study looks to identify an assessment design construct that overcomes these issues. Specifically, this study introduces an authentic assessment that combines gamification (G) with heutagogy (H) and multimodality (M) of assessments, building upon rich pool of multimodal data and learning analytics (A), known as GHMA. This is a skills-oriented assessment approach, where learners determine their own goals and create individualized multimodal artefacts, receive cognitive challenge through cognitively complex tasks structured in gamified non-linear learning paths, while reflecting on personal growth through personalized feedback derived from learning analytics. This pilot research looks to: (i) establish validity of all elements within the assessment design, and (ii) identify if application of assessment design leads to improved learner satisfaction. Results showed positive validations of all key elements of the GHMA assessment model, as beneficial factors tied to positive learner satisfaction on assessment delivery. There existed statistically significant post- and pre-treatment differences between experimental and control group satisfaction levels, indicating positive receptivity of GHMA authentic assessment design in digital education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a quantitative approach using a survey method. The respondents were students at a college in Indonesia. The respondents were students at a college in Indonesia. Data were collected using a questionnaire distributed to students via a Google form. Furthermore, the data were processed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings: From a demographic profile, the study describes that students choose Google to search for information rather than to the library, the most used gadget is a smartphone, the average access to information is 2–7 h per day and the purpose of information access is to do assignments. The results of the statistical tests show there is a relationship between heutagogy learning and DL. Research limitations/implications: This study will help policymakers to develop DL in a vocational school. Originality/value: This research will contribute to the improvement and implementation of heutagogy learning emphasis on a DL case study in Indonesia. This research can assist policymakers in preparing DL skills in heutagogy learning in vocational school. This research will add new literature, methodology and framework on heutagogy learning and DL to library and information management field. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics’ positioning through a typology of epistemic views. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) pedagogy refers to principles, methods, and practices used in teaching and learning vocational skills. TVET is focused on preparing individuals for the world of work by acquiring practical skills and knowledge. In recent years, pedagogical approaches toward flexible learning have been integrated. The teaching design in higher education nowadays enhances learning outcomes and prepares learners for the 21st-century workplace. Three pedagogical approaches were selected in designing the concept of TVET teaching strategy and integrated based on heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy. Heutagogy encourages self-directed learning, while peeragogy fosters collaboration and learning from each other. Cybergogy uses digital technology to integrate TVET education, equipping students with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to thrive in the digital age and prepare them for future jobs. The concept of Heuta-Peera-Cyber was proposed after careful analysis of literature and past research. The result shows the principles of heutagogy can be linked with collaboration with peers and implementing technology to improve and develop learning experiences. In summary, by providing the resources for learning, the concept of teaching design can help to invent a more engaging, effective, and enjoyable learning experience. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Muhammad Mujtaba Asad, Prathamesh Padmakar Churi, Fahad Sherwani, and Razali Bin Hassan.

	abstract = {As the shift to distance learning was abrupt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, neither university students nor instructors were fully prepared. There was a real demand, therefore, for adopting principles that belong to Education 3.0 in higher education institutions as this pandemic might not be the last. This study aimed at evaluating to what extent the principles of Education 3.0 based on the heutagogical approach could be applied at universities. To achieve this target, a mixed approach was followed by utilizing two instruments; a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. A total of (200) students and (10) instructors from Birzeit University (BZU) were the participants. Data that emerged from the questionnaire were statistically analyzed, whereas the interviewees’ responses were qualitatively content-analyzed and grouped into main themes. The findings revealed that some principles of Education 3.0 have not been fully applied yet at BZU, such as supporting the learners’ self-determination; the individualization of teaching methods and strategies; blending synchronous online teaching mode with the face-to-face; empowering and coaching students to build personal learning environments with using multiple tools of authentic and real-life evaluations. Accordingly, it was recommended that universities worldwide as well as other higher education institutions should adopt the principles of Education 3.0 to make the shift to distance learning smooth for both students and instructors, especially by using flexible curricula and open learning resources; empowering students to determine their needs, objectives and personal learning environments; individualizing the teaching methods; and avoiding “One-size fits all” strategies. © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

There is a lack of validated research instruments to measure self-determined learning among postgraduate students. The Postgraduate Self-Determined Learning Questionnaire (PSLQ) was specifically developed to fill in the gaps. This study aims to examine the validity and reliability of the PSLQ through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The original version of PSLQ has 59 items and it was administered to a sample of 201 postgraduate students from a researchintensive university in Malaysia. The results of EFA revealed that PSLQ measures four distinct factors; learner-centered learning, interactive non-linear learning, double-loop reflection, and capacity development, which accounted for 54.22% of the variance in self-determined learning. The total number of items in PSLQ has been reduced to 42, after 17 items were removed. The instrument demonstrated excellent internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha value of α=.959. The findings suggest that PSLQ is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to measure self-determined learning among postgraduate students.

Around 320 million learners were prevented from going to schools/colleges across India causing a sudden joltin all educational activities. Despite the challenges, higher education institutions responded affirmatively and evolved to harness the advantages of assistive technologies to ensure the continuity of teaching–learning activities, research, and thus service to the society. The paper discusses the evolution of the blended learning paradigm and its efficacy to ensure higher learning specifically at the tertiary level. In the quest to identify a suitable instructional mechanism, academic institutions have pursued a variety of techniques including synchronous, asynchronous, or mixed-mode heutagogic learning approaches. The researchers seek to use a thematic literature review of the various relevant learning models to explain the nuances of blended learning attributed to the factors of commitment, flexibility, collaboration, and self-paced managed learning environments.

The goal of the paper is to show the acceptance and a level of appropriateness of social media for study purposes perceived by students. Results from three consecutive studies form the backbone of the presented paper showing the trends in the acceptance of social media and satisfaction with them. Two areas are analysed: social media as a means of communication in the process of education and social media as a tool enabling students’ revision and testing of study materials. This kind of research corresponds to the increased need to develop desired self-study skills in students, especially in the context of Covid19 experience. The first studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the identical set of examined social media and fit the comparison enabling to define the trend in students’ satisfaction with social media for study purposes. The third study discussed in this paper was run during winter semester of 2021. The set of examined social media in the questionnaire was adapted to reflect the current social media scene. Experience with the abrupt shift to online platforms caused by global crisis has significantly affected the process of education exposing and endorsing the power of heutagogy.

	abstract = {The approach that students take in their studies at university is critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in life-long learning for their career and professional development. Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively. Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material. Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term compared to ‘cramming’ of information. To evaluate the use of effective study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years, suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching. Practitioner Notes 1. Self-determined learning places an expectation that learners self-regulate and take responsibility for their learning. Student’s independent study within a programme helps to consolidate learning. 2. Study habits and preferences vary among individuals however there is clear evidence from cognitive science that not all study approaches are effective. 3. Undergraduate students are using suboptimal study methods such as rereading notes, recopying notes and cramming information the night before a test. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during learning. 4. Students report that they are not using approaches taught to them by teachers. It has been shown that learners incorrectly predict suboptimal methods as superior to evidence-based approaches. We suggest that evidence-based study approaches are explicitly emphasised and embedded within courses. 5. We recommend to senior managers with learning and teaching remits (Directors of Learning and Teaching, Pro Vice-Chancellors for Education and Student Experience) that faculty staff are informed about evidence-based learning approaches from cognitive science and increase metacognitive awareness in their teaching. © 2022, University of Wollongong.

Faced with the problem of successfully designing a self-determined comprehensive evidence-based online numeracy resource for educators who are often time poor and do not engage with online learning unless they are intrinsically motivated, we engaged in design research to conceptualise the Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide for educators and families. The Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide fosters educators’ and adult learners’ numeracy capability across numeracy focus areas from birth to level 10 (16-year-olds). This extensive OPD resource incorporates consistent design elements, double-looped learning, nonlinear learning, self-reflection, and metacognition activities to foster educators’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through experiential learning. With a section dedicated to families, the resource provides suggestions and advice to parents and carers on everyday, authentic activities to develop children and young people’s numeracy understandings at home and in the local community. As education systems continue to grapple with the disruption brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide is a timely, freely accessed, viable, and scalable option for providing low-cost OPD © 2022, International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning.All Rights Reserved.},
