This means that the approach to teaching and learning in higher education should place the emphasis on students that are autonomous and self-directed Approach. This leads to profound implications for designers of open and distance learning (ODL) study materials as students in this environment usually reside far away from the institution and often feel alienated when starting this learning process. E-learning can change this landscape to become a platform where knowledge can be shared and discussed amongst peers. In this chapter I will, through a case study, give an example of such a process that not only creates a virtual rich environment for active e-learning, but also delivers critical thinking graduates to the workplace. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

Through the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), students now can share content directed at external audiences, i.e., audiences other than the instructor. These audiences are referred to as authentic audiences as they are public-facing and exist outside of the classroom. The existing literature offers evidence of student satisfaction with assignments directed at appealing to external audiences, however, the literature provides no comprehensive pedagogical rationale for assignments directed at authentic audiences wherein the goals are self-determined. The authors discuss the theory of heutagogy, the study of self-determined learning, as an approach for assessing assignments that utilize ICTs and are directed at authentic audiences.

	abstract = {The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the classroom for learning is becoming important to improve student engagement and interaction. This is in line with the educational transformation towards achieving Higher Education 4.0 in Malaysia. Education 4.0 (Edu 4.0) is in line with the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (4IR) and underpin the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025. There has been a recent surge in published studies on Mobile-Heutagogy (M-Heutagogy), with most studies has been conducted in developed countries, where the outcomes of the studies have revealed that MHeutagogy has significant impacts on Edu. 4.0. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to discuss the M-Heutagogy pedagogical affordances of such a tool, the challenges that it poses, and the pedagogical change that is entailed for the adoption of the M-Heutagogy in the classroom. As a preliminary investigation in Malaysia, this study was carried out based on the phenomenological perspective of selected student teachers concerning the above affordances and challenges of MHeutagogy through interviews. It was revealed that the use of such a novel learning tool helped spur their students' interest, stimulate their curiosity, and improve their confidence in learning scientific concepts. In particular, the use of M-Huetagogy has proven can help to improve student participation in the learning process through more intense discussions among student teachers, which led to an improved understanding of learning concepts. However, the main barriers to full integration of such a tool in teaching and learning were attributed to the lack of technical support, teaching skills and confidence, and suitable facilities. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.},

Facilitating professional development for lecturers to engage with innovation in teaching and learning utilizing new technologies is no simple process. However, we have found that structuring lecturer professional development around a sustained community of practice can result in a journey of conceptual and pedagogical transformation [1]. The increasing ubiquity of mobile devices and social media provides a platform for enabling pedagogical change. Thus we established a MOBile Community Of Practice (MOBCOP) of lecturers interested in researching the potential of mobile social media in education interested in exploring the concept of the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum [2], and how mobile learning can be utilized as a catalyst [3] to move towards student-directed heutagogy. We argue that the MOPCOP framework is potentially applicable to a variety of higher education contexts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Students in higher education are using mobile devices, which challenges our understanding of what it means to learn in modern environments. By using mobile devices as instruc-tional aids, students gain a variety of social, cognitive, and technical abilities. Mobile devices may therefore be seen as supporting the growth of employability skills and broader lifelong learning, both of which may be helpful in a variety of circumstances. The quickly evolving landscape of technology and education presented teachers with a number of challenges, and they had to retrain and refresh their skills in order to provide practical training. As a result, heutagogical methods are ideal for enhancing their collective knowledge and skills. Online and blended learning (BL) offer a learning environment that incorporates technological affordances to facilitate learning. This enables the growth of an independent, capable, and self-directed lifelong learner. Heutagogy provides an educational strategy in this context that may link the development of lifelong learning competencies with BL and online learning environments. Using this methodology, we investigate the potential contribution of online and blended higher education to technology-enabled lifelong learning where heutagogical experiences are available. The results support the notion that heutagogy and lifelong learning are linked by some basic concepts that apply to both mixed and online learning environments. © 2024 by the authors of this article.},

	abstract = {Creativity of thought and critical thinking are two concepts that faculty struggle with teaching in higher education, particularly in the distance learning environment. Bloom's taxonomy has been used to define taxonomic levels in learning since the 1950's; "create" is one of its highest taxonomic levels. It can be difficult to create relevant, authentic assessments that require students to display both synthesis of meaning, as well creative synthesis of concepts learned to reach this "create" level in an effective manner. Transformative learning and especially heutagogy or "self-determined learning" can be used as theoretical curriculum models or frameworks to help students learn and solve problems. These two theories are particularly effective when leveraged with technology. Today's instructional technologies allow students to more readily create and explore new concepts on their own to generate a more fulfilling education process with meaningful relevant practice and assessment. © 2021 by IGI Global.

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study of affordances in educational technology focuses on how the selfperceptions of teachers influence the creation of educational opportunities and how these are received by learners. Background It is important to explore the affordances offered by teachers, when using educational technology, from the perspective of their students. Within this topic, the interface of the educational technology affordances with the two agents—teachers and students—has often been neglected. Hence, the learning possibilities in educational interactions for the learners cannot be separated from the interactional possibilities created by teachers. The extent to which teachers can create opportunities to address their students’ needs, while effectively conveying the value of these opportunities to their students, is likely to impact on how well these affordances for learning and collaboration are utilised. Methodology A survey that includes two questionnaires was used. The questionnaires were circulated to 102 teachers and their 354 adult students in six higher education institutions in Oman. The questionnaires were analysed by SPSS Amos v20 for statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation. Contribution The study contributes to the field of e-learning because it demonstrates that the affordances offered by teachers for e-learning have an impact on the possibilities for students to engage. Both affordances were found to be highly correlated statistically. Further, teachers were found to primarily use the lowest level of engagement for online tasks, requiring low levels of cognitive challenge and social involvement from the learner. Findings The results indicate a low to medium level of self-directed learning that significantly correlates with perceptions of teaching possibilities for learning interactions. Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers are encouraged to vary approaches to student engagement in online teaching materials such as enhancement, additional engagement opportunities, and extension so that students are encouraged to use different cognitive abilities and capabilities to engage in social interactions. Impact on Society This study presents a strong recommendation with regards to extending the online affordances towards social interactions of learning beyond the boundary of the classroom. Future Research Further studies on e-heutagogy and affordances of both teachers and students are needed. The effect of teachers created opportunities on students learning actions is an area that grants further investigation. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

	abstract = {Our research question focuses on how industry-based practices enable learning experiences between a wide range of collaborators and in a variety of spatiotemporal surroundings, including educational contexts, supported by the latest technological evolutions. We start with the observation that the advent of the digital transformation of our society bridges the gap between industry and academia and provides many opportunities for the future by expanding learning experiences. This change has been undeniable since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, the success of apprenticeship training (Cerdin and Peretti in The success of apprenticeships, 2020; Montargot and Drillon in Succ Apprentice Views Stakeholders Train Learn 3:79–86, 2020) shows a growing interest in blended learning (Dziuban et al. in Int J Educ Technol High Educ 15:1–16, 2018) and ‘mixed processes and practices’ (Parsons and MacCallum in Agile and lean concepts for teaching and learning. Springer, 2019) on the part of companies and universities. Based upon three lecturers’ experiences in France, this chapter provides practical insights about how to align industry-based practices and higher education by focusing on three specific methods/approaches: ‘learning-by-doing’ through workshops, ‘project-based learning’ by means of case studies, and ‘heutagogy’ via mixed modes. Our aim is to highlight key challenges and barriers, advantages and opportunities of these three different approaches, and to suggest recommendations to support further development of innovative digital teaching and learning practices in higher education. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

The convergence of these factors has left higher education institutions scrambling and institutional, teacher, and learner roles in a state of flux. Heutagogy, also called self-determined learning, offers a teaching and learning framework for navigating the oncoming storm. The theory draws on established learning theories - humanism, constructivism, andragogy, transformative learning, and complexity theory - and the latest neuroscience to create a composite map for institutional leaders, teachers, and learners alike to apply to professional and lifelong learning. This chapter explores the tenets of heutagogy and how a heutagogical learning approach can be supported using the latest technological developments and be implemented in pedagogically meaningful ways in order to develop learners who are able to excel in today’s complex, global workforce. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Furthermore, we explore the use of ChatGPT as a medical instructor in a medical classroom context. We seek to elucidate responses to a preset of questions in two categories separated based on targeted remediation, pedagogical knowledge, teacher ethics, query detail, practicality, and communication pattern. These responses are analyzed based on two rubrics designed on the basics of pedagogical prerequisites, and findings are reached with a thorough comparative analysis.

	abstract = {This study was initiated to address the limited bibliometric analyses on heutagogy, despite its growing prominence in higher education as a learner-centered, self-determined approach. As the field gains momentum, understanding its research landscape is essential for guiding future pedagogical practices and scholarship. We conducted a bibliometric review of 290 publications from 2005 to 2024 indexed in the Scopus database, applying PRISMA guidelines and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer was used to analyze citation networks, co-authorship patterns, and keyword co-occurrences. Findings show a significant increase in publications, peaking in 2020, with Blaschke identified as the most cited author and Cochrane as the most prolific. Auckland University led institutional contributions. The research spans disciplines such as education, computer science, and business, with thematic focuses on educational technology, lifelong learning, and 21st-century skills. However, collaboration remains largely regional, indicating opportunities for broader international engagement. The review highlights heutagogy's growing impact on flexible and technology-enhanced learning environments. These insights have practical implications for curriculum development, instructional design, and educational policy. Conclusively, heutagogy is poised to play a transformative role in higher education, particularly in promoting autonomy, adaptability, and lifelong learning.

The learning design intends to improve learning ecosystems, bolster student engagement and afford learners and educators the benefit of choice and amplified autonomy. Second-year students at North-West University (South Africa) will be the first cohort to experience the application of the newly-designed basic literacy framework which informs the broader role-playing learning design exhibited here. The Web literacy framework put forward by Mozilla in 2018 to teach critical online proficiencies serves as the inspiration for the framework; informing the overall role-playing learning design at various levels. Depth of Knowledge indicators are mapped onto the Mozilla framework to deepen its applicability to tertiary education contexts. Elements of gamification, furthermore, are imbedded into the learning design to engage students with the self-directed learning aspects of the concept itself, i.e. to participate in authentic learning experiences as put forward by heutagogical instructional strategies. The role-playing learning design makes three roles available to learners, namely: Business Analyst (Read), Web Developer (Write) and Customer Service Representative (Engage). These roles are tied directly to the three basic literacy skill areas iterated upon in the basic literacy framework discussed here. Moreover, this article represents part one in a series of articles exploring the efficacy and potential of this approach to better serve our student cohorts and expand educational offerings.

	abstract = {The increasing shift from learning solely face-to-face towards various forms of online and blended or hybrid styles of educational interaction between faculty and students has been a feature of higher education over the past three decades. With improved internet access for individuals and small organisations, this shift has become even more pronounced and recognised as a major opportunity to provide a more equal geographical and social access to learning opportunities. The restrictions to travel and the gathering of large groups during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a major paradigm change for many institutions to adopt online course delivery. This has also necessitated a significant change in thinking about how online educational interaction is designed and delivered, and in many cases, the pedagogical change is running behind the changes in technology that facilitate improved distributed communications. The University of the Highlands and Islands in Scotland has been a significant early adopter of online education. This chapter attempts to summarise some of the key lessons learned in the design and implementation of learning and teaching strategies that encourage and support students to utilise online resources to enhance their own education.

The predominant reference of these terms has been for higher education (college level and beyond). It assumes that the student is a mature and motivated adult who is able to take in discrete pieces of information and assimiliate it coherently to learn. This paper explores how Education 3.0 concepts are implemented in the realm of elementary education with a focus towards increasing students' learning outcomes. This paper combines our research in heutagogy by drawing on data from an intelligent tutoring system called Mindspark that has been used by over 80,000 students in 150 private schools over the past five years as well as in 5 afterschool remedial centres in urban slums of Delhi. There is a shift in educational processes - characterized by the transformation from a teacher-led delivery model to a student-led learning experience. In this Education 3.0 model, the learner is no longer a passive recipient but rather becomes an active player in defining their learning environment, the teacher-learner interaction, affective factors of learning, evaluation, interventions and finally achievement - all towards achieving higher outcomes on students' learning.},

Educators need to rethink existing teaching approaches to better prepare learners for future careers that Industry 4.0 will create. The World Economic Forum defined a new education model, called Education 4.0, which contains eight major changes to redefine learning in the new economy. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is an approach that promotes critical thinking, social-emotional skills, and life-long learning. These skills are necessary for Education 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to recommend the principles of heutagogy as an effective teaching and learning approach to meet the needs of Education 4.0. The approach of the study examines existing literature on Education 4.0 and heutagogy. A conceptual model that interconnects heutagogy to the four learning principles of Education 4.0 will be offered as a key finding to answer the research question: How does heutagogy in higher online education meet the needs of Education 4.0?

	abstract = {Can a new instructional approach influence lifelong learning and the development of competent lifelong learners? Blended and online learning provides a platform for learning that introduces technological affordance to enable learning. We seek to find an intersection between blended and online learning and lifelong learning through an instructional approach that encourages learners towards management of their own learning. This opens the door to becoming an autonomous, capable, self-directed lifelong learner. In this context, heutagogy offers an instructional approach that may connect blended and online learning settings with the development of lifelong learning competence. After conducting a systematic literature review using the terms heutagogy, blended and online learning, and lifelong learning, literature that considers how to inspire and build human agency capabilities over the lifespan was chosen for Delphi method expert review. Using this methodology, we explore the possibility that online and blended higher education will contribute, where heutagogical experiences exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Results corroborate the idea that heutagogy and lifelong learning are intertwined by some common principles and that these are applicable to both blended and online learning settings and lifelong learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Recent, and what is often continuous, change is impacting all we do, including the design and delivery of education. This change requires new instructional models that improve immediate learning outcomes and prepares learners for learning across the lifespan. The use of instructional processes labeled heutagogy include the opportunity for, and application of, activities of learning self-direction, -determination, and -regulation, which can be helpful, even essential, for lifelong learning. What this paper adds This paper identifies an informed perspective, from data, that heutagogical design must be consciously implemented and supported for online and blended learning by instructional designers, instructors, and institutional leadership and infrastructure. It is reasonable to suggest that online and blended learning could contribute, where heutagogical learning opportunities exist, to technology-enabled lifelong learning. Instructional practices that include choice, flexible or negotiated assessment, facilitation of reflection, learner confidence development, and involvement of the learner in designing their learning can be considered heutagogical. Implications for practice and/or policy Develop policy in support of a change in instructional practice that embraces a heutagogical approach in the design of courses to foster greater self-directed and lifelong learning. Educational development to support instructors to understand heutagogy and how it can be applied in the design and delivery of blended and online learning to foster technology enabled lifelong learning. With the implementation of a heutagogical approach, student orientation along with purposeful scaffolding needs to be implemented to support students as they become more autonomous learners in technology-enabled settings. © 2021 British Educational Research Association},

	abstract = {For transformation to occur in learning environments and for learners, higher education must first consider how such transformation will occur for the designers and facilitators of learning experiences: the university teachers or educators we call faculty (in the US), instructors, lecturers or professors or, in some instances, university staff. For the purpose of this article, we will refer to them as educators or faculty, and the process of their professional development as educational development or faculty development (more historically common in the US context). We aspire towards universities in the future that cultivate connected, participatory educational development that crosses institutional and national boundaries, and which takes equity, social justice and power differences into consideration, promoting educator agency. We propose theoretical underpinnings of our approach, while also highlighting some examples of recent practice that inspire this direction, but which are small in scale, and can provide springboards for future approaches that may be applied on a wider scale and become more fully integrated, supported and rewarded in institutions. Our theoretical underpinnings are influenced by theories of heutagogy and self-determined learning, transformative learning, connectivist and connected learning, and an interest in equity. We share models of alternative approaches to educator development that take advantage of the latest advances in technology, such as #DigPINS, Virtually Connecting, collaborative annotation, and dual-pathway MOOCs. We then share a semi-fictional authoethnography of our (the authors’) daily connected lives, and we end by highlighting elements of the models we shared that we feel could be adapted by institutions to achieve educator professional development that is more transformative, participatory, and equitable. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Research in eLearning and technology enhanced learning (TEL) has predominantly focused on the creation of learning materials in appropriate forms, such as learning objects, the assessment methods that can usefully be applied online, and the delivery mechanisms for these materials, particularly in virtual learning environments (VLEs). In more recent times, research has begun to focus on pedagogical issues, and in particular whether there is some specific model that applies explicitly to online learning situations. Through a number of projects over the last ten years the authors have considered issues of learning style, learning strategy, pedagogy, immersive environments, student engagement and motivation, games-based learning, adaptation and personalisation. Emerging from this work, and from extensive consideration of the existing research in this area, this paper argues a need to move not only to a different pedagogic model, but also to change the existing structural approach to learning to support the rising demand for online distance learning provision worldwide. Fundamental to this argument is a need to support a heutagogic model of student learning, which requires that the students involved are sufficiently educationally mature to take control of their own learning experience. Whilst within traditional teaching models in higher education there is an explicit aspiration that students will emerge as educationally mature, metacognitive graduates, this is often seen as an outcome of the learning process itself, rather than as a skillset which can be taught and assessed. The paper describes an approach to metacognitive assessment that has already been used to determine the level and skills displayed by students in making selections of learning materials online. Based on this approach, a structural model for online learning support is proposed, using an assessment, feedback and training loop to ensure that students have the level of metacognitive skills necessary to take effective control of their own online learning experience.},

	abstract = {Preparing students for the complex and changing nature of the workforce has become an overriding objective within higher education. New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students’ self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner’s acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the e-portfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also offers recommendations for future practice and theory. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required students to become more self-directed in their learning. In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self-determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self-determined way. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills. The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self-directed learning skills in learners. Heutagogy has been identified as a net-centric teaching and learning theory for online learning. What this paper adds Positions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self-directed and lifelong learning skills. Explores the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy. Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self-determined learning. Implications for practice and/or policy This study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for developing self-directed and lifelong learning skills.

Reducing this gap requires communicative literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which emphasize the use of technology, self-determined learning, and collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the participation of 124 Mexican students of technical-professional education. The study’s objective was to analyze how they scaled their communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico. Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic thinking (z = –2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly higher mean (M = 25.36) than men (M = 25.11). Qualitative results support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90%). This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital literacy. © 2024 The Author(s).},

This means that most educators, especially those in post-schooling education, will use, and be responsible for designing, an online course site. While there is a tendency to use course sites as a repository and convenient communication medium, there is an unmet need to design these sites in a way that facilitates learning. As online teaching and learning become more prolific, especially in higher education and adult learning contexts, it is increasingly necessary to design course sites that facilitate learning as opposed to course sites that are just repositories. Just like the approaches that a teacher uses in classroom teaching, the teacher's underpinning philosophy will impact the way they will design their course sites on an LMS or website. Despite technology and online being present for over two decades, course design and teaching in the online environment remains trapped in traditional behaviorist and content-driven approaches. © 2023, IGI Global.

	abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice. We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this offers opportunities for ‘teachable moments’ (Newell et al, 2023) and gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them, and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

	abstract = {With the advent of e-learning, advocates use the term interactivity instead of interaction among students, and between the teacher and the students. Many universities use Moodle for online teaching and learning. This paper explores the perceptions and experiences of students in three Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Mauritius. A mixed-methods approach was used, with an online survey questionnaire administered to 600 students and focus group discussions were conducted with 15 students from these institutions. It was found that 68.4% of respondents used WhatsApp compared to only 23.6% of them who used the e-learning platform, Moodle. There were no associations between the use or frequency of using WhatsApp or Facebook and the types of HEI to which the students belonged. Students preferred WhatsApp due to its facility for knowledge sharing and construction, its interactivity, its usability, respect for privacy and instant communication. From the findings, it is recommended that HEIs bring a shift in their approaches to teaching and learning from cognitivism to socio-constructivism, connectivism and heutagogy.

	abstract = {(1) Background: Although HIV has not diminished in importance in Canada, the field of HIV research remains small, and the graduate students who decide to pursue careers within it feel isolated and uncertain about their professional skills and opportunities. Universities Without Walls (UWW) was created in 2009 to help redress these shortcomings. This paper presents a case study of UWW, a non-credit training program for emerging HIV researchers in Canada. In particular, we focus on the possibilities of experiential learning via online and blended delivery. UWW uses both online and in-person teaching modalities to teach engaged scholarship, interdisciplinarity, community-based research (CBR), intervention research, and ethics. (2) Methods: Using a case study, we elucidated the research question: “What are the factors that make Universities Without Walls a viable training environment in the contemporary HIV/AIDS field?” Focus groups were conducted with 13 UWW key stakeholders in 2012 during a program mid-point evaluation; in 2014, telephone or in-person interviews with the three directors were conducted by a UWW fellow (the 4th author of this paper), and in 2019 the authors analyzed the information and anecdotal evidence, which had been incorporated as thick description. In addition, fellows’ self-assessments via portfolio and results from formal learning assessments were included. We also thematically analyzed 65 student self-reports (2009–2015). (3) Results and Discussion: Each UWW cohort lasted 9 months to one year and was comprised of: a) sustained mentorship from the co-directors (e.g., phone conversations, assistance with grant writing, letters of reference, etc.); b) fortnightly online webinars that aim to develop fellows’ knowledge of community-based research (CBR), research ethics, intervention research, and interdisciplinary research; c) community service learning in the form of a “field mentoring placement”; d) face-to-face engagement with fellows and mentors, most notably at the week-long culminating learning institute; e) a stipend for fellows to carry out their training activities. The UWW pedagogical framework features experiential learning, critical pedagogy, and heutagogy made manifest in the field mentoring placements (community service learning), mentorship mediated by technologies, and in-person learning institutes. Our analysis showed that experiential learning was imparted by UWW’s a) transparency about its “implicit curriculum”, the attitudes, values, character, and professional identity imparted in the program as well as the overarching programmatic elements, such as commitment to diversity, the inclusion of those with lived experience, the flexible admissions policies and procedures, interdisciplinary faculty, flexible team, administrative structure, and valuing of technology in conducting research, learning, and teaching; b) curriculum co-designing and co-teaching, and c) sustaining a community of practice. The main results reported in our case study included significant “soft outcomes” for UWW fellows, such as developing a “social presence” as a precursor to lasting professional connections; learning to experience community-based research, intersectionality, and interdisciplinarity by interacting online with persons living with HIV, leaders in the field, and a variety of stakeholders (including nonprofit staff and policymakers). (4) Limitations: While fellows’ self-evaluation data were collected by an independent assessor and anonymized to the extent this was possible, the co-authors inevitably bring their preconceptions and positive biases to UWW’s assessment. As UWW was developed to function outside of traditional academic structures, it is unlikely that the UWW program could be transferred to a post-secondary environment in its entirety. UWW was also built for the socio-political environment of HIV health research. (5) Conclusions: The experiences of those involved with UWW demonstrate that explicit curricular components—such as interdisciplinarity, community-based research, intervention research, and applied ethics—can be learned through a blended delivery when combined with opportunities to apply the knowledge in ways, such as a field mentoring placement and a learning institute. Related to this outcome, our case study describes that implicit curricular components in the formation of a professional—the sense of self in the field as a researcher, student, and community member—can also be delivered through a blended model. However, the tools and activities need to be tailored to each student for their context, while pushing their disciplinarian and professional boundaries. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart technology, artificial intelligence and robotics have recently become the focus of the new industrial revolution, which now influences our daily lives. The process of teaching and learning at higher education institutions needs to be updated to meet the challenges of Industry 4.0. Different types of learning spaces and pedagogies, such as heutagogy, are required. Although heutagogy has been practised for a long time, there is a deficiency in studies which review the existing literature about implementing heutagogy. In light of this fact, this article is, therefore, a systematic review of the literature on the application of heutagogical methods in universities worldwide. This study utilized publications from 2016 to 2020 from databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, ACM Library, Science Direct, Emerald Insight, Taylors & Francis Online, as well as from the alternative database Google Scholar. The search efforts resulted in a total of 23 articles that can be systematically analyzed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). By using ATLAS. ti 8 as a tool, this review has five main themes, namely, i) ICT; ii) Blended Learning; iii) Outside Classroom Activities; iv) Distance Learning and; v) Module or Curriculum Related. The results showed that heutagogy is a suitable approach that can be applied in this era and that it is recommended that this approach be implemented during this COVID-19 season. Finally, at the end of this research, a number of recommendations for future scholars will be discussed.  © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.},

Around 320 million learners were prevented from going to schools/colleges across India causing a sudden joltin all educational activities. Despite the challenges, higher education institutions responded affirmatively and evolved to harness the advantages of assistive technologies to ensure the continuity of teaching–learning activities, research, and thus service to the society. The paper discusses the evolution of the blended learning paradigm and its efficacy to ensure higher learning specifically at the tertiary level. In the quest to identify a suitable instructional mechanism, academic institutions have pursued a variety of techniques including synchronous, asynchronous, or mixed-mode heutagogic learning approaches. The researchers seek to use a thematic literature review of the various relevant learning models to explain the nuances of blended learning attributed to the factors of commitment, flexibility, collaboration, and self-paced managed learning environments. The paper proposes a narrative of andragogic styles that are universal and acceptable for higher education institutions to practice and avoid disruption to education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The collaboration was founded through establishing a like-minded community of practice built upon mutual trust, and the formation of a transdisciplinary design team. The STUDIO602 project demonstrated the mutual benefits of authentic collaboration between industry and higher education. Universities have expertise in supervising and mentoring student research teams to solve real-world problems. By building authentic collaboration between university research teams and hospital design teams innovative solutions to practical health care problems can be solved. Such collaborative design partnerships will lead to better health outcomes for society as innovative solutions to pre-hospital care, out-patient care, and innovative design of hospital infrastructure and technology-enhanced practices are developed. Extending these collaborations to international teams working remotely together we can widen the impact of the developments beyond New Zealand, and bring into the design team international expertise as well. We discuss the application of several techniques used in the software industry and how they relate to the STUDIO602 project—these include design thinking, team management, stakeholder engagement and rapid prototyping techniques. The innovation we are illustrating in this chapter through this project example are the development of pedagogical design principles to facilitate authentic collaboration between student design teams and industry. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

	abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics’ positioning through a typology of epistemic views. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) pedagogy refers to principles, methods, and practices used in teaching and learning vocational skills. TVET is focused on preparing individuals for the world of work by acquiring practical skills and knowledge. In recent years, pedagogical approaches toward flexible learning have been integrated. The teaching design in higher education nowadays enhances learning outcomes and prepares learners for the 21st-century workplace. Three pedagogical approaches were selected in designing the concept of TVET teaching strategy and integrated based on heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy. Heutagogy encourages self-directed learning, while peeragogy fosters collaboration and learning from each other. Cybergogy uses digital technology to integrate TVET education, equipping students with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to thrive in the digital age and prepare them for future jobs. The concept of Heuta-Peera-Cyber was proposed after careful analysis of literature and past research. The result shows the principles of heutagogy can be linked with collaboration with peers and implementing technology to improve and develop learning experiences. In summary, by providing the resources for learning, the concept of teaching design can help to invent a more engaging, effective, and enjoyable learning experience. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Muhammad Mujtaba Asad, Prathamesh Padmakar Churi, Fahad Sherwani, and Razali Bin Hassan.
