Title = {`Nice to Meet You Again': When Heutagogy Met Blended Learning in Teacher
   Education, Post-Pandemic Era},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Heutagogy and blended learning (BL) are core concepts in the educational
   discourse post-COVID-19. Conducting a mixed-methods study, we
   investigate meeting points between heutagogy principles and BL in the
   context of curricular change in the academic timetable of teacher
   education college, where pre-COVID most courses have been taught
   face-to-face (F2F). At present, teacher educators and students meet F2F
   for three weeks, followed by a week of remote learning, combining
   synchronous and asynchronous pedagogies. Data have been collected by a
   closed-ended questionnaire and two focus groups, involving altogether 76
   lecturers and 553 students. Findings indicate that heutagogy has been
   applied in all facets of BL, rather than only with online or digital
   technological components. This study explores a bottom-up growth of
   heutagogy expressions in BL at three meeting points. When the core
   facets of heutagogy principles have been identified, there has been a
   predominance of the students' agency and life-long learners, together
   with facets such as a non-linear learning and capability development
   that have been underrepresented. This study contributes to the research
   field of heutagogy in teacher education as it identifies the meaning and
   the way a structural change in the curriculum can constitute an
   accelerator and catalyst when implementing heutagogy in practice.},

Abstract = {The covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the way teachers and students
   interact in the classroom. The pedagogy approach has been pushed to
   transform into Andragogy. Current research aims to investigate the
   student experiences with the andragogy approach and its potential impact
   on students' self-regulated learning. Andragogy, heutagogy, peeragogy,
   and cybergogy principles used by the teacher as part of distance
   learning during the pandemic will be modelled to check their effect on
   the student's self-regulated learning. The results show that andragogy,
   heutagogy, cybergogy, and peeragogy have significant effects on
   self-regulated learning. Andragogy is proven to be based on heutagogy,
   peeragogy, and cybergogy since it has a strong effect on these 3
   approaches. The least path coefficient among them is shown by the path
   between andragogy and cybergogy. Andragogy also has a significant
   indirect effect on self-regulated learning through the approaches. The
   results may lead to a conclusion that andragogy, heutagogy, cybergogy,
   and peeragogy can be used as an effective way to improve the student
   self-regulated learning.},

   biblical wisdom literature, the teachings of Jesus Christ, and the work
   of the Holy Spirit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 24},
Abstract = {Heutagogy-also known as self-determined learning-empowers individuals to
   take charge of their personal growth by fostering proactive approaches
   to self-development. In a Christian context, self-enacted spiritual
   growth can operate within a range of personal, denominational, and/or
   hermeneutical understandings of discipleship. Moreover, self-determined
   learning transcends diverse Christian traditions, mirroring different
   expressions of the role and work of the Holy Spirit in capacitating
   Christian discipleship. This conceptual paper contributes to the
   literature by expounding and advocating heutagogy as an
   under-appreciated framework for facilitating spiritual growth. To
   construct its argument, the paper draws on three sources: biblical
   wisdom literature, the teachings of Jesus Christ, and selected
   expressions of the continuing work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of
   Christian believers.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to describe digital literacy (DL) and heutagogy
   and examine the relationship between the
   two.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a quantitative
   approach using a survey method. The respondents were students at a
   college in Indonesia. The respondents were students at a college in
   Indonesia. Data were collected using a questionnaire distributed to
   students via a Google form. Furthermore, the data were processed using
   Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).FindingsFrom a
   demographic profile, the study describes that students choose Google to
   search for information rather than to the library, the most used gadget
   is a smartphone, the average access to information is 2-7 h per day and
   the purpose of information access is to do assignments. The results of
   the statistical tests show there is a relationship between heutagogy
   learning and DL.Research limitations/implicationsThis study will help
   policymakers to develop DL in a vocational school.Originality/valueThis
   research will contribute to the improvement and implementation of
   heutagogy learning emphasis on a DL case study in Indonesia. This
   research can assist policymakers in preparing DL skills in heutagogy
   learning in vocational school. This research will add new literature,
   methodology and framework on heutagogy learning and DL to library and

Abstract = {Teaching approaches are important in assisting lecturers in efficiently
   planning and delivering their lectures. Technological advancements
   should be applied not just for internet access and communication, but
   also in the teaching and learning (TnL) process. This study was designed
   to develop a website-based E-Module of the heutagogy learning approach
   to improve the teaching and learning process in the Measurement Tools
   Course, Electrical Technology Certificate Program in Community Colleges.
   The proposed E-Module is expected to make the lectures more engaging and
   effective for students. A product design and development approach was
   employed in this study to collect data from 15 respondents, comprising
   five experts and ten lecturers from the Southern Zone Community College.
   The usability of the E-Module in terms of interface design, interaction,
   content, and heutagogy learning approach was assessed through expert
   evaluation forms and user questionnaires. Resultantly, the usability
   evaluation of this E-Module revealed a high degree of agreement in terms
   of interface design, interaction, and content. Respondents also agreed
   that utilizing the heutagogy learning approach is incredibly relevant
   and may improve lecturers' teaching sessions. Nevertheless, larger-scale
   research is needed to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of this
   E-Module of heutagogy learning approach in enhancing students' knowledge
   and competencies, particularly in the Measurement Tools Course.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the implementation levels of Heutagogy,
   Peeragogy, and Cybergogy approaches among instructors at vocational
   colleges in Malaysia. Employing a quantitative survey research design,
   data were collected from a sample of 241 instructors across 15
   vocational colleges, representing various Technology fields such as
   Automotive, Electrical, Electronic, Construction, Welding, Industrial
   Machining, Refrigeration \& Air Conditioning, and Computer Systems \&
   Network Technology. The sample was selected using a cluster stratified
   convenient sampling method. Demographic information, including gender,
   age, race, institutional zone, vocational college, program, experience,
   qualification, certificate, and class, was gathered. A structured
   questionnaire comprising 53 items served as the primary data collection
   instrument. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software to derive
   frequency values, percentages, mean scores, and standard deviations. The
   Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed to identify
   differences in the implementation of Heutagogy, Peeragogy, and Cybergogy
   approaches among the instructors. The findings indicate a high level of
   implementation for Heutagogy and Peeragogy approaches, while the
   Cybergogy approach is practiced at a moderate level. Significant
   differences were observed in the implementation of these approaches
   based on the instructors' fields and teaching experience. To enhance the
   practice of Cybergogy, it is recommended that vocational college
   administrations provide training workshops or courses to improve the
   teaching skills of their academic staff for 21st st century learning

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to address the United Nations' Sustainable
   Development Goal 4 ``quality education{''} through the adoption of
   heutagogic ideas in improving work-based learning for individuals.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper locates a discussion of
   heutagogy within the wider context of vocational and higher education,
   as well as through reference to the theoretical discourse on learning
   theory. Findings - Heutagogy is concerned with the development of
   individual capability through the creation of a learner-determined
   curriculum that is attuned to professional goals. Organizations that
   adopt heutagogic approaches enhance corporate adaptiveness through
   personalized learning. Originality/value - This briefing provides the
   reader with an accessible insight into both the individual and
   organizational benefits of adopting heutagogic ideas in professional
   development. As organizations confront an increasingly uncertain
   external environment, this paper offers an insight into how to develop
   individual capability.},

Title = {Heutagogy: A self-determined learning approach for Midwifery Continuity
   of Care experiences{*}},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this discussion paper is to discuss learning theories in
   midwifery education, as related to the Midwifery Continuity of Care
   Experience and to propose an original conceptual framework based on
   Heutagogy.Background: Midwifery education curricula include a number of
   midwifery practice experiences. One of the requirements is for students
   to provide Midwifery Continuity of Care. To achieve these experiences,
   students in Australia are required to provide care to at least ten (10)
   women through pregnancy, be on call for the woman's birth and provide at
   least two visits post-birth. Continuity of care experiences appear to
   have been incorporated without sufficient consideration of the
   educational purpose of the experience, or how the experiences contribute
   to the development of the profession. Although we do know midwifery
   practice embraces woman-centred care as its philosophical underpinning,
   a learning approach that is congruent with this philosophy needs to be
   clearly articulated. Design: A discussion paper that compared and
   contrasted learning theories to align with Midwifery Continuity of Care
   experiences. Methods: A review of the literature on learning theories
   was conducted before comparing and contrasting the theories to arrive at
   a conceptual framework focused on learning theory and its application to
   the Midwifery Continuity of Care Experience.Results: Heutagogy provides
   a potentially congruent educational learning approach to underpin the
   continuity of care experiences, in comparison to traditional learning
   theories of pedagogy and andragogy. With a paucity of research in the
   application of heutagogy to midwifery education, it's conceptual
   underpinnings and the possible application to the Continuity of Care
   Experience, this paper explores the possible theoretical applications of
   heutagogy to midwifery education.Conclusion: As a learning theory,
   heutagogy is well aligned with woman-centred care. Heutagogy provides a
   theoretical framework suitable to underpin strategies, including the
   conceptual framework proposed, that may assist in empowering students to
   participate in their own education by giving them the ability to be self
   determined in both their approach to learning and to evaluate their own
   learning needs.},

Title = {Engaging and Empowering Malaysian Students Through Open and Distance
   Learning in the Post-COVID Era},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {With the outbreak of COVID-19, online open and distance learning (ODL)
   has become increasingly relevant, particularly among those who aim to
   pursue postgraduate studies. ODL provides an opportunity for many to
   study while working or raising a family. Nevertheless, ODL programs are
   associated with low student engagement and high non-completion rates
   compared to traditional programs. Among the main contributing factors
   are communication and course design, which relate to the level of
   responsiveness of instructors and the quality of course design thus
   delivery through online. An innovative approach is needed to address
   these issues, and heutagogy seems to be a viable alternative.
   Nevertheless, the heutagogical approach alone is incomplete without
   considering the instructional scaffolding technique that can affect
   adult students' engagement. This study introduces a model that combines
   heutagogy and instructional scaffolding (HEIS) as a guideline in
   conducting a fully online ODL course called Technology and Media Design.
   It interrogates the impact of the course design from the perspective of
   postgraduate students and instructors in one of Malaysia's public
   universities. Recommendations include for faculties with ODL courses to
   continuously help develop instructors' competencies and using more
   suitable assessment approaches e.g., project-based.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the utilization of the video game Grand Theft Auto
   as a unique tool within the lecture theatre to develop contemporary
   heutagogy. Drawing upon the authors' personal reflections in the form of
   an autoethnographic account across a four year period, the challenges
   and benefits of utilizing the approach within in-person and virtual
   learning environments is interrogated. Utilizing video games as a means
   to ensure students are active participants whilst learning complex
   theoretical paradigms has proven highly beneficial, aiding in the
   reduction of attainment gaps and wider barriers to learning. So too, the
   approach has enabled cohorts to disentangle criminological problems
   whilst being empowered to question the nature of public criminology
   within contemporary discourse. Active engagement with video games whilst
   in the lecture theatre, by both students and lecturers, has enabled a
   dynamic and inclusive learning environment.},

Title = {Heutagogy as an alternative in teacher education: conceptions of
   lecturers and pre-service teachers of school of education and life-long
   learning, SDD-UBIDS},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Introduction The needs of today's higher education have changed and
   higher education does not need a one-way communication from teacher to
   student but rather learn to appreciate the new role of the teacher as a
   facilitator with mutual responsibilities toward the creation of
   knowledge. Heutagogy, which emphasizes learner autonomy and the creation
   of self-determined learners, has garnered attention as a potential
   solution to address the evolving needs of teacher preparation. However,
   empirical research on the beliefs and attitudes of Heutagogy within the
   teacher education context remains limited. This study aimed to fill this
   gap by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of lecturers and pre-service
   teachers of the School of Education and Life-Long Learning (SoELL) at
   SDD-UBIDS.Methods Convergent mixed method design with both quantitative
   and qualitative data analysis, the study collected both quantitative and
   qualitative data on 513 Pre-service teachers and 30 Lecturers from
   SoELL, SDD-UBIDS using a four-point Likert scale questionnaire and
   interview.Results The findings revealed diverse perspectives among
   Lecturers and Pre-service Teachers regarding Heutagogy, with varying
   levels of understanding, acceptance, and readiness for implementation.
   Lecturers expressed enthusiasm for Heutagogy's potential to foster
   learner autonomy and critical thinking skills, while pre-service
   teachers demonstrated varying levels of readiness and comfort with
   self-directed learning approaches.Discussion Lecturers and Pre-service
   teachers expressed willingness to embrace a self-determined approach in
   which the learner reflects on what is learned and how it is learned and
   where the Lecturers teach the learners how to learn by themselves. The
   cognitive conflict and the inadequacy of pre-service teachers'
   preparedness will necessitate a shift in their attitudes toward
   developing autonomy skills to effectively navigate the challenges of the
   21st-century knowledge economy.},

Abstract = {The development of the digital transformation era has had a major
   influence on the current occupational fields. The challenges faced by
   the next generation of the nation are getting bigger; this is also felt
   by internship teachers (teacher training) who carry out school field
   introduction programs from universities. Seeing the low output to be
   able to get the opportunity to become a teacher with a bachelor's degree
   in education is the main concern of inequitable global civilization. The
   aim of the research is to focus on knowing the needs of internship
   teachers related to digital competence training before they carry out
   the school field introduction program. The research method used is a
   mixed method with a total of 160 active students at Brawijaya University
   who will become internship teachers. The results of the study reveal
   that the need for the aspect of gaining new competencies is 85\%, the
   development of digital competencies is very high, especially in the
   aspect of integrating digital pedagogy, and the knowledge aspect is 65\%
   for increasing heutagogy-based e-training experiences. This study
   concludes that the need for internship teachers for the existence of
   heutagogy-based e-training is very much needed to realize an equitable
   global civilization in the era of digital transformation.},

Abstract = {Mobile learning is well established in literature and practice, but
   under-evolved from a rigorous learning design perspective. Activity
   theory presents a sophisticated way of mapping and understanding
   learning design, but for mobile learning this does not always translate
   into change in practice. The reported research addresses this by
   coupling a mobile learning specific approach to activity theory with a
   practice-based framework: the design for transfonnative mobile learning
   framework mapped to the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy continuum matrix
   (the DTML -PAH Matrix). Seven case studies are analysed using this
   approach and presented narratively along with framework informed
   analysis. Findings include that the DI'ML -PAH Matrix can be used to
   provide clearer implications and guidance for mobile learning practice,
   and that the DTML -PAH Matrix can also be guided by the practice over
   time. Implications for further research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of
   conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of
   academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by
   academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if
   we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in
   the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology
   have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn,
   and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from
   universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the
   future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has
   attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control
   over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst
   academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12
   academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their
   views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the
   concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little
   epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are
   going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development
   should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in
   their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics'
   positioning through a typology of epistemic views.},

Abstract = {An increasing number of neurodivergent learners attend higher education.
   This necessitates examination of best-fit learning models to
   successfully support the current generation of college students. While
   pedagogy and andragogy have historical relevance, in isolation, they may
   lack alignment with the individualization embedded in
   neurodiversity-affirming practice. This study conceptualized a novel
   learning framework for neurodivergent college students through the lens
   of neurodiversity-affirming practice. Via constant comparative
   qualitative analysis of American university faculty interviews and
   framework juxtaposition, three themes were identified: pedagogy vs.
   andragogy, self-determination, and interdependency. Thematic analysis
   revealed uncertainty regarding best-fit learning framework, with
   consensus reached regarding complexity of serving neurodivergent adults
   in post-secondary settings. An innovative framework titled ``Building a
   Heutagogical Bridge{''} was envisioned, describing the role of
   heutagogy, student-centered, self-determined learning, in connecting
   signature pedagogical and andragogical approaches. This study revealed
   the potentiality of implementing and assessing approaches to skillfully
   incorporate heutagogical, pedagogical, and andragogical principles in
   higher education settings. The perspectives of faculty from the USA
   within this study can inform neurodiversity-affirming practice in
   American universities, while providing implications for future study and
   practice in international college settings, where contexts, needs, and
   culture may differ.},

Abstract = {Personalisation plays a vital role in the engagement of adult learners
   in online learning environments. Historically, research has focused on
   applying adaptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence,
   without integrating those technologies within teaching and learning
   approaches. Academagogy is a teaching and learning approach that allows
   an educator to select appropriate parts from the models pedagogy
   (educator-centred), andragogy (learner-centred), and heutagogy
   (learner-driven) for better learning outcomes. Previous studies used
   academagogy in face-to-face learning contexts; however, academagogy's
   application has been limited in online learning contexts. This paper
   presents our interim observations of applying academagogy to an online
   Information Technology course. Using mixed methods to analyse learner
   self-reflections, online learning analytics, learner grades, learner
   surveys, and learner interviews, we observed that learners progressed
   along the PAH continuum towards andragogy and heutagogy, with some
   exceptions. The exceptions were found where learners regressed on the
   PAH continuum when they encountered problems. The exceptions provide
   insights into the problem areas that block learner engagement and
   achievement, laying a foundation for future work in personalising the
   online learning experience.},

Abstract = {In the context of contemporary coaching, it is necessary to explore
   approaches that cater to the needs and preferences of modern learners.
   Given the emergence of online/remote coaching and coach development
   (ORC/CD) in recent years, this could involve the exploration of
   frameworks and onto-epistemologies that better ensure alignment with
   contemporary understandings of learning in the digital era. In the
   current article, we take the opportunity to explore some of the possible
   theoretical considerations that can inform future research in this
   emerging area; and thus support the application of technology-enhanced
   coaching/learning in sport coaching contexts. First, we philosophically
   position our arguments within a `new culture of learning' (NCOL) - a
   framework that is congruent with online learning experiences. From
   there, we consider Connectivism - as an expression of New Materialism -
   as a suitable onto-epistemology to guide future research given its
   recognition of networked ways of being in the twenty-first century. We
   conclude by suggesting heutagogy (self-determined learning) as an
   appropriate signature `similar to gogy' for ORC/CD environments.},

Abstract = {This study determines and analyzes the principles of interactive
   scenario design supporting critical and creative thinking in
   asynchronous learning environments. The study was conducted as a
   qualitative research, framed by two theoretical approaches, heutagogy
   and inquiry-based learning, and a holistic case study. The basic
   principles of the theoretical approaches and then theoretical matrix
   where sixteen semi-structured interview questions transformed later on
   were the beginning of the study. Semi-structured interview questions
   were given to 7 open and distance learning field experts and the data
   was collected. For the data analysis descriptive and content analysis,
   for content analysis inductive analysis was used. NVivo12 was employed.
   The result of the study shows that in the design of interactive
   scenarios which is the basis of interactive videos, 4 main themes, which
   are (1) Support Productivity with Natural Curiosity, (2) Create
   Self-awareness, (3) Provide Self-discovery, (4) Spark off Intellectual
   Transformation, 16 themes describing the main themes and 55 sub-themes
   were achieved. The components leading the interactive scenario design
   where the themes explaining the main themes and the sub-themes take
   place were used as a checklist in the form of hypothesis.},

Abstract = {As a result, mathematics teachers are prompted to focus on the
   heutagogical approach. However, challenges arise, like inadequate
   training and support among mathematics teachers. Thus, this study
   concentrated on formulating a series of teaching activities aligned with
   the heutagogical approach, specifically tailored to assist mathematics
   teachers in enhancing their teaching methods. This study was conducted
   using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) involving 15 experts with various
   fields of expertise such as mathematics education, educational
   technology, heutagogy, pedagogy and the curriculum as well as primary
   and secondary school mathematics teachers. The data was collected from
   October 2023 to November 2023 by using a questionnaire as the primary
   means of collecting data. Findings were analysed using triangular fuzzy
   number, threshold value, percentage for expert consensus and
   defuzzification process to determine the acceptance and ranking for each
   teaching activity. The results indicate that teachers assign projects
   that require students to explore real-world applications of mathematical
   concepts, were ranked first, followed by other activities, while
   teachers arrange virtual sessions with guest speakers from the
   mathematics field to provide insights to real- world applications were
   ranked last. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights for
   mathematics teachers interested in enhancing student-centered learning
   within the framework of Education 4.0.},

Title = {Integrating four teaching and learning methods to deliver
   transformational social work education online},
Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 1},
Abstract = {As responsive social work education is about meeting the dynamic needs
   of learners, social work educators engage with innovative approaches
   that promote teaching and learning (TAL). The purpose of this article is
   to address the research question: Based on our experience as educators,
   what TAL methods can support social work and human services curriculum
   delivery in an online environment? Using the co-operative research
   method and analyzing our reflections, we proposed a model of curriculum
   delivery which conceptualizes the application of four methods of TAL
   (pedagogy, andragogy, heutagogy, and paragogy). We also illustrate how
   this teaching approach can promote different levels of learning (single,
   double, and triple- loop learning). The model is based on
   internationally agreed principles of social work and can incorporate
   non-Western and Indigenous learning processes. We argue that when
   educators and learners use these four methods in different combinations,
   it is possible to produce learning experiences that augment social work
   skills and knowledge development, as well as prepare learners for a
   multi-dimensional world of change. The implication is that there is
   scope in the presented model to promote transformational learning and
   ways of positive engagement during social disruption and dynamic change,
   both features in our current global environment.},

Title = {Assessing Research Trends in Spiritual Growth: The Case for
   Self-Determined Learning},
Journal = {RELIGIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A review of the contemporary Australian church reveals a spiritual
   malaise in which passive learning has become the main staple for many
   church members or attendees. This sense is heightened by demographic
   trends over the last fifty years that reflect a sustained decline in
   Australians identifying as religious. Although commitment to
   Christianity is seemingly softening, this sociodemographic picture is
   contraindicated by other research that reflects a growing hunger for
   spirituality among many Australians. Given this disparity, there is an
   opportunity to re-examine pertinent understandings of spiritual growth.
   In the literature, notions of spiritual growth are conceptualised by a
   variety of definitions and operationalised by a range of tools and
   practices. Analysis suggests that many models are limited by linearity,
   passivity, and reductionism and do not adequately resonate with the
   complexities inherent in spiritual growth. This literature review
   extends previous research by examining the state of the art in relation
   to spiritual growth. The paper converges around the synthesis that
   heutagogy and coaching are effective twin strategies that may direct
   self-determined learning towards enhanced spiritual growth. This paper
   conceptualises opportunities for future research and thereby lays the
   foundation for an important emergent research agenda. This article
   charts pertinent perspectives and prospects.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the development of a special interest group bound by
   common interests, experiences, and access to opportunities in mobile
   learning as a model of a networked academic development community. With
   core members spanning eleven educational institutes across three
   continents, the Mobile Learning Special Interest Group (MLSIG) was
   established to facilitate mobile learning praxis to enable authentic
   learning and learner agency through a networked community of academic
   practitioners and researchers. The paper identifies critical elements of
   the MLSIG networked community through an autoethnographic narrative from
   14 self-nominated participants. These are woven into a proposed
   framework and model for nurturing networked academic development
   communities.},

Abstract = {Blended learning is widely known for its ability to improve learning,
   nevertheless little is still known about the best ways of designing
   effective blended learning environment which can support immersive
   learning such as greater learning experience and accessibility to
   education. In this respect, this study investigates the mapping of the
   principles of three Education 4.0 innovative pedagogies, namely,
   heutagogy, peeragogy, and cybergogy, with the capabilities of three
   technological learning tools, that is, Facebook (FB), Learning
   Management System (LMS), and Blog, via a systematic literature review
   technique. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used as the methodology, and the
   literature was further selected using Gough's Weight of Evidence
   criteria, resulting in 59 studies. The results show that cognitive
   factor is the most linked pedagogical principle to the four main
   capabilities of technological learning tools, that is, time,
   self-related, learning task, and learning community-related. This
   mapping is useful for instructors to plan learning and teaching by
   choosing the technological learning tools that match with appropriate
   Education 4.0 pedagogies for optimising the immersive blended learning
   practices.},

Abstract = {The development of survey items includes the preparing and validating
   the items. A construct validity and reliability are two important
   concepts in survey research that are used to assess the quality of
   survey items. This study was conducted to generate on the construct
   validity process of the survey items in heutagogy elements specifically
   for vocational learning. Items have been developed based on relevant
   literature and the context of vocational education in particular leads
   to readiness for employment. Therefore, to go through the process of
   validity and reliability of the items, this study involved 100 students
   from Vocational Colleges to response the survey items. There are 71
   items in a set of questionnaires with six elements consists of
   Exploring, Collaborating, Relationship, Creating, Reflection and
   Sharing. The data was analysed based on Rasch Model as statistical
   measurement model that can be used to assess the validity and
   reliability of research instruments. The construct validity was examined
   by analysing the point-measure correlation index, infit, and outfit
   values; meanwhile, the reliability was examined by analysing the item
   reliability index. The results have shown that the findings of the
   analysis found seven items dropped because the items did not meet the
   requirements of the established analysis. By analysing the data
   collected from the questionnaire, the final instrument shows a total of
   64 items suitable for measuring six elements of heutagogy. The Rasch
   Model differs from other measurement models in reliability assessment by
   focusing on one dimensionality, assessing both person and item
   reliability, enabling item calibration, and providing fit statistics.
   Hence, this systematic approach may facilitate researcher to improve the
   items to produce the good quality of research instrument.},

Abstract = {Much of the criticism levied against executive education has focussed on
   its lack of real-world relevance. Such is the bifurcation between
   executive education and professional practice that it has been described
   as a `valley of death'. Albeit dramatic in tone, this view of executive
   education points to the need for radical change in the way Business
   Schools conceive and deliver the curriculum. Hitherto, EE has been
   characterised by a pedagogy based on the functional delineation of
   learning to cohorts of students through standardised programmes. In
   recent times, Business Schools have adopted andragogical approaches as
   they look to empower students to exercise greater control over their
   learning-but is this sufficient? Heutagogy offers a view of learning
   that is centred on the self-determination of how individuals learn and
   that is embedded in authentic and life-long learning. This substantive
   review offers a view of future executive education through the
   theorisation of how a heutagogic approach may inform future curriculum
   developments.},

Title = {Measuring Learning Presence as Fourth Dimension in the Community of
   Inquiry Survey: Defining Self-Regulation Items and Subscales through a
   Heutagogical Approach},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The Community of Inquiry (CoI) has increased in popularity in almost 25
   years due to its adaptability which has spanned from asynchronous
   text-based environments up to a wide range of different settings. The
   CoI identifies the mutual interaction of three dimensions named
   presences. The survey to detect the perception of presences is a
   Likert-scale survey based on 34 items arranged in 10 subscales which are
   assigned as follows: 4 to teaching presence, 3 to social presence, and 3
   to cognitive presence. Several studies identified alternative
   arrangements of the main components as a result of EFA and CFA.
   Consequently, the exploration of alternative settings keeps on revealing
   variations in the way presences interact with each other. The ongoing
   debate about whether to add a fourth dimension, specifically learning
   presence, has produced numerous publications but no definitive revised
   version of the survey. This study suggests an extension of the classical
   survey by incorporating a supplementary set of 12 items related to
   learning presence inspired by the theory of heutagogy (or
   self-determined learning). The sample for the experimental
   four-dimensional CoI framework comprised 55 university students. The
   analysis investigated the internal correlations of this extended survey,
   revealing positive expectations and opportunities for further
   adaptations.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to create a reliable and valid
   measurement tool for measuring self-determined learning skills among
   university students. The research was conducted with the participation
   of 574 university students. In line with expert opinions and
   suggestions, 30-item trial form of the scale was developed. The
   collected data were subjected to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a
   structure that explained 42.17\% of the total variance was obtained. It
   has been determined that the Self-Determined Learning Skills Scale
   (SDLSS) consists of 22 items and four dimensions. In addition, as a
   result of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), it was seen that the fit
   indices of the scale were between excellent and acceptable values, and
   the four-factor structure of the scale consisting of 22 items was
   confirmed. The Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient of the
   scale is.86, and the reliability coefficient calculated by the
   split-half method is.80. To determine the distinctiveness of the items
   in the scale, the corrected item-total correlation was calculated, and
   27\% lower-upper group comparisons were made. Findings from item
   analysis showed that all the scale items were distinctive. As a result,
   it can be said that the ``SDLSS{''} developed is a valid measurement
   tool and will provide reliable scores in determining self-determined
   learning skills.},

Abstract = {Opportunities for self-determined online professional development (OPD)
   are emerging, but their potential for increasing adult learners' agency
   is not yet fully realised. Faced with the problem of successfully
   designing a self-determined comprehensive evidence-based online numeracy
   resource for educators who are often time poor and do not engage with
   online learning unless they are intrinsically motivated, we engaged in
   design research to conceptualise the Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide
   for educators and families. The Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide fosters
   educators' and adult learners' numeracy capability across numeracy focus
   areas from birth to level 10 (16-year-olds). This extensive OPD resource
   incorporates consistent design elements, double-looped learning,
   nonlinear learning, self-reflection, and metacognition activities to
   foster educators' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) through
   experiential learning. With a section dedicated to families, the
   resource provides suggestions and advice to parents and carers on
   everyday, authentic activities to develop children and young people's
   numeracy understandings at home and in the local community. As education
   systems continue to grapple with the disruption brought about by the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the Birth to Level 10 Numeracy Guide is a timely,
   freely accessed, viable, and scalable option for providing low-cost OPD.},

Abstract = {Education 4.0 emphasizes the use of hybrid approaches in the learning
   process. The use of peeragogy, heutagogy, and cybergogy may engage
   students in the learning processes in which active learning plays a key
   role. This study aimed to examine the effect of the implementation of
   the Merdeka Curriculum on active learning practices and their
   relationships with hybrid activities based on hybrid learning
   approaches, and active learning counterparts of (1) self-regulated
   learning: (2) self-directed learning, and (3) self-determined learning.
   These relationships will be examined in Indonesian curriculum
   implementation in which student-centered principles are emphasized. A
   cross-sectional survey was conducted by collecting responses of
   vocational high school students on survey. The digital questionnaire was
   sent to 600 Indonesian students, of whom 555 completed it. The
   relationships among the constructs were examined using a structural
   equation modeling. The results showed that a curriculum emphasizing
   student-centered principles was fully mediated by active learning and
   hybrid activities to promote student self-regulated learning (SRL),
   self-determined learning (SDET), and self-directed learning (SDL).
   Active learning and hybrid activities directly affect students' SRL,
   SDET, and SDL, Three counterparts of active learning that form important
   parts of long-life learning. This model indicates that Indonesian
   curriculum implementation may encourage active learning and indirectly
   increase learner engagement, autonomy, and metacognitive development.},

Abstract = {To enhance the current postgraduate educational learning environment,
   this quasi-experimental case study examined the implementation of the
   Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy (PAH) Continuum as an instructional
   framework for developing basic competencies and learner autonomy among
   50 postgraduate students. This is in response to the high attrition
   rates and students' failure to graduate on time, afflicting the quality
   of postgraduate education in Malaysia. Data were collected via pre and
   post-tests, a questionnaire, and focus-group interviews. The findings
   revealed significant improvement in the students' critical reading and
   research skills, while their learner autonomy level was moderate due to
   personal and cultural limitations.},

   (GLI) in socio-scientific issues (SSI). Results showed that active
   learning had a direct effect on GLI, while critical thinking and group
   participation self-efficacy had indirect effects on GLI as mediated by
   active learning. Critical thinking showed a significant direct effect on
   active learning, and a significant indirect effect on active learning
   that was mediated by group participation self-efficacy.},

Abstract = {To aid and better understand the current postgraduate educational
   learning environment, this study examined the implementation of the
   Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy (PAH) Continuum as an instructional
   framework for developing competencies and learner autonomy among
   postgraduate (PG) students. This is in response to the high attrition
   rates and postgraduate students' failure to graduate on time, afflicting
   the quality of PG education in Malaysia. A mixed-method descriptive case
   study design was employed, involving pre and post-tests, a
   questionnaire, and focus-group interviews. The findings revealed
   significant improvement in the students' critical reading and research
   skills, while their autonomy level was moderate due to personal and
   cultural limitations.},

Title = {Editorial: Artifiicial Intelligence is Awesome, but Good Teaching Should
   Always Come First.},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream
   of society some twelve months ago has seriously challenged learning and
   teaching practice. Since then, AI companies such as OpenAI are
   constantly improving their language models and releasing new features to
   make them more capable and useful. So, given there have been many
   disruptors in the past and emerging disruptions in the present, what can
   we learn in this situation, where Generative AI stands poised to
   challenge the purpose and relevance of assessment models? From our
   examples, disruptive technologies only have a major impact when they
   positively transform practice and are informed by pedagogic models and
   learning theory. GenAI as a disruptor is only likely to have this
   positive impact when it informs quality learning and teaching practice.
   We should be focused on the opportunities that GenAI now presents to
   higher education. It is argued here and elsewhere that the relative
   weakness of GenAI is that it creates poor quality output, delivering
   uninformed, incorrect, biased and bland responses. In itself, this
   offers opportunities for `teachable moments' (Newell et al, 2023) and
   gives us room to support students with their capabilities in an AI
   informed world. Historically, these opportunities enable higher
   education to grow and progress. What we have learned so far would
   appears to be that for research to contribute to the literature, they
   needed to be informed by it. Likewise, need to ensure that pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy come first. We also need to remember that
   people processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them,
   and that artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence.
   Practitioner Notes1. For AI research to contribute to the literature, it
   needs to be informed by it.2. Scholars need to ensure that pedagogy,
   andragogy, and heutagogy come before artificial intelligence.3. People
   processes happen, artificial intelligence happens around them, and that
   artificial intelligence comes after human intelligence. 4. Artificial
   Intelligence comes after human intelligence},

Abstract = {This study of adventure sports learners expands on earlier work on
   adventure sports coaching. We examine learners' perceptions of their
   coaching and its effect on their self-efficacy and independence as
   adventure sports performers. We utilise a convergent mixed approach that
   deploys the Outdoor Recreation Self-Efficacy Scale, pre- and
   post-coaching, and a reflexive thematic analysis of semi-structured
   interviews. The findings indicate improved self-efficacy and greater
   independence as a result of the coach's practice, supporting our initial
   conjecture that the adventure sports coaches in this study developed
   independence as a definable outcome of their coaching practice.},

Abstract = {Background
   The systemic problems and challenges of general practice within the
   health system require systemic solutions.
   Objective
   Noting the complex adaptive nature of health, illness and disease, and
   its distribution within communities and general practice work, this
   article suggests a model for general practice that allows the full scope
   of practice to be developed while creating seamlessly integrated general
   practice colleges that support general practitioners on their journey to
   `mastery' in their chosen discipline.
   Discussion
   The authors discuss the complex dynamics underpinning knowledge and
   skills development throughout doctors' careers, and the need for policy
   makers to evaluate health improvement and resourcing based on their
   interdependencies with all societal activity. To succeed, the profession
   would have to adopt the principles that form the foundation of
   generalism and complex adaptive organisations to strengthen its ability
   to successfully interact with all its stakeholders.},

   This study investigated the impact of blended learning and incorporating
   these innovative pedagogies, namely, heutagogy, pedagogy, and cybergogy,
   on the performance of business studies learners in the framework of
   contemporary legislation. Despite e-Learning and information and
   communication technology being integrated in South African schools that
   offer business studies, challenges persist in successfully implementing
   blended learning strategies aligned with recent legislation. This
   research centers on the central problem: the obstacles teachers
   encounter when they apply blended learning approaches in the context of
   business studies, considering the implications of recent legislation. by
   using critical social theory as its theoretical framework, the study
   adopted a participatory action learning and action research methodology.
   The research instruments employed include a SWOT analysis and the
   fishbowl approach, which facilitated data generation by co-researchers,
   namely, two preservice teachers, two in-service teachers, one
   information technology specialist, one school principal, two Grade 12
   learners, and two parents. Through critical discourse analysis, the
   findings reveal gaps in the understanding of optimal approaches to
   designing effective blended learning environments that are capable of
   supporting the advancement of business studies in the context of recent
   legislation. Furthermore, the study uncovers that comprehensive guidance
   for creating immersive blended learning environments, which are crucial
   for enhancing and contextualizing learning experiences for the
   21st-century business studies learners, is absent. In conclusion,
   blended learning has brought about transformative shifts in teaching
   methodologies for business studies, which emphasize the importance of
   teachers comprehending the intricacies of learner-centered learning. The
   positive influences of this approach on academic accomplishments,
   learner engagement, and learning outcomes are evident through its
   technology-driven implementations. In particular, learners expressed
   favorable perceptions of blended learning, and saw their increased
   interaction with peers and teachers as a significant advantage.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the design of a blended learning intervention to
   enhance the student learning experience, incorporating innovative
   technologies and pedagogies within introductory accounting. The
   design-based research (DBR) methodology involved 68 learners in the
   participatory design of the intervention across three design iterations.
   Emerging from the design process, a framework informed by the key themes
   of Pedagogy, Autonomy, Collaboration, Engagement, Interaction and
   Technology (PACE-IT) was conceptualised, tested and developed. This
   study presents the PACE-IT model which offers guidelines to
   practitioners who seek to design blended learning to provide students
   with a rich and meaningful learning experience. The emergence of
   COVID-19 underscores the relevance of these findings. PACE-IT provides
   direction to accounting educators working within an unfamiliar
   educational context, today and in the future, where there is an
   imperative to develop new approaches to accounting education that
   combine face-to-face with online interaction and learning.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the initial development of a
   learner -centered teaching (LCT) in the ``Sports Coach{''} course, from
   the Sports Science program at University of Campinas. Following a
   qualitative approach and action research procedures, we present the
   planning, implementation, and evaluation of the LCT in the course
   through the program and institutional plan, class plans and logbook; the
   teachers' perspective through critical-reflective conversations and
   logbook entries; the opinions of the student-coaches through
   questionnaires and focus group. We used the thematic analysis technique.
   The LCT showed to be complex, especially due to the appropriation of
   principles and development as an approach. The student-coaches perceived
   an approximation of the course to the practical reality of the coach,
   contributing to motivation and significant learning. We emphasize the
   need to train teachers in LCT and to take the role of coach developers
   in coach education in university.},

Abstract = {Open education resource (OER) has become an increasingly important topic
   for consideration in the open distance learning (ODL) context. ODL
   students' education should be learner-centered based on intrinsic
   motivation and OER usage. The purpose of this study was to explore the
   student teachers' experiences in using open education resource in ODL.
   Even though many studies have been conducted on OER in ODL, there are
   insufficient empirical studies that have explored environmental
   education (EE) student teachers' experiences in using OER in the ODL
   environment. In exploring this topic, the qualitative research
   methodology, interpretive paradigm, and rhizomatic approach were used.
   Participants and documents were purposefully sampled. Data was ethically
   collected through documentation and semi-structured telephonic
   interviews. The data were thematically analysed and processed to find
   patterns, keywords were identified, coded, and clustered into
   categories, and themes emerged. Qualitative findings showed that EE
   student -teachers knew about OER informally and some students wanted to
   use OER. Hindrances to OER usage by student-teachers included little
   engagement with OER by lecturers and costs to access OER.},

Abstract = {Mixed reality (XR) environments combining real-to-virtual immersive
   experiences provide unprecedented potential for reframing educational
   pedagogy and practice. XR environments provide scaffolded learning
   points accommodating individual needs, while enhancing sensorial and
   embodied experiences. XR environments can facilitate self-determined
   (heutagogical) experience-based learning and esthetic visualization of
   wicked problems, making complex knowledge more accessible. Here we
   report on a study exploring the design of mobile learning with education
   outside the classroom (EOTC), heutagogy, and free-choice learning to
   enhance marine ecological literacy, based on a bring your own device
   (BYOD) XR intervention at a marine educational center in Aotearoa New
   Zealand. Findings indicate that XR affordances can enhance the
   understanding of complex marine conservation science, facilitating
   ecological literacy knowledge, attitudes and behavior change.
   Implications include pedagogical rethinking of EOTC with self-determined
   mobile learning; haptic, sensorial and embodied XR design considerations
   for environmental education; and epistemological speculation on learning
   phenomena in real-to-virtual immersive environments.},

Abstract = {support is presented in the article as the activity of a teacher,
   focused on the personal development of a student as an adult learner in
   a situation of overcoming difficulties in the learning process and
   implemented through the cooperation of all subjects of the educational
   process, taking into account individual typological characteristics and
   life experience of the individual. It is shown that the effectiveness of
   the implementation of andragogical support for students in the process
   of teaching a foreign language is ensured through the use of the
   following didactic conditions: taking into account individual
   difficulties and subjective educational experience of a student as an
   adult; practice-oriented nature of the content of training that meets
   the goals and needs of adult learners; integration of individual, group,
   and collective forms of educational activity; application of game and
   problem teaching methods; the relationship and interdependence of
   control and self-control of the results of students' educational
   activities.},

Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The Covid 19 pandemic requires critical re-evaluation of the way Higher
   Education can help students maximise their learning to adjust and adapt
   to a new reality. This requires a holistic approach which extends beyond
   consideration of student learning in formal settings to understanding
   the role informal learning can play. Whilst research exists on informal
   independent learning, less focus has been placed on how students
   collaborate informally as part of their learning process. In this study
   interviews with HE students in Spain and the UK offer insight into
   variable but beneficial informal collaborative learning (ICL) practices.
   The value attributed to ICL emphasises its potential contribution to the
   current educational landscape and the merit of recognising it as a
   distinct concept. Further, uneven access and the role of learner
   maturity signal the potential for universities to enhance learning and
   increase access by playing an active a role in developing ICL skills and
   personal networks.},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {In this study, we aim to investigate the potential advantages of
   integrating the new generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
   ChatGPT, into higher education, specifically within the field of medical
   education. The focus is on exploring ChatGPT's applications in
   personalized learning, assessment, and content creation while also
   addressing the management of its limitations and ethical considerations.
   Furthermore, we explore the use of ChatGPT as a medical instructor in a
   medical classroom context. We seek to elucidate responses to a preset of
   questions in two categories separated based on targeted remediation,
   pedagogical knowledge, teacher ethics, query detail, practicality, and
   communication pattern. These responses are analyzed based on two rubrics
   designed on the basics of pedagogical prerequisites, and findings are
   reached with a thorough comparative analysis. We hope that this research
   will improve the effective implementation of ChatGPT as a tool for
   enhancing learning and skill development while maintaining ethical
   awareness for medical professionals.},

Title = {Heutagogical Design Principles for Online Learning: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 14},
Abstract = {In higher education, heutagogical design principles may be utilized to
   foster active teaching and learning to engage learners in an online
   learning environment. This research study aims to investigate the
   application of heutagogical design principles such as exploration,
   creation, collaboration, connection, reflection, and knowledge sharing.
   Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to identify and analyze the
   potential use of heutagogical design principles across a variety of
   online instructional approaches, including personalized learning, peer
   learning, smart learning, self-regulated learning, independent learning,
   learner-centered learning, facilitative learning, collaborative
   learning, free-choice learning, and lifelong learning within the
   theoretical framework of heutagogy. The results revealed that the most
   frequent instructional approaches included collaboration,
   self-regulation, personalization, and lifelong learning. Thus,
   instructional approaches encouraged students to connect with peers and
   instructors within the facilitative learning environment. As a result,
   instructors developed students' 21st century skills in the scope of
   engaging, meaningful, and experiential learning environments. Online
   teaching and learning in higher education might be diversified based on
   heutagogical principles and instructional approaches and their
   subsequent implementation in the context of higher education.},

Abstract = {An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that high-level
   adventure sports coaches are developing their learners towards a
   personalised conception of independence in their activities. However,
   how coaches do this has yet to receive much attention. This
   investigation draws on a thematic analysis of 10 semistructured
   interviews that followed coaching sessions with an explicit focus on
   developing independence. Three themes emerged: developing a cognitive
   performer, an attuned coaching process that fosters independence, and
   developing the individual's capacity to learn. The findings suggest that
   learners have an explicit comprehension of the ``what and why{''} of the
   performance and coaches develop the learner's ability to learn both how
   and where to continue their development postcoaching. The coaches
   achieve these two objectives by developing a long-term independent
   performance in their coaching practice. Coaches are not trying to
   develop fully independent performances during coaching, but instead to
   prepare learners to continue their development with adaptable
   performances within the practicalities of learning in adventurous
   environments.},

Abstract = {Early childhood educators' professional knowledge and skills are often
   underappreciated (Moloney, 2015; Moss, 2006) even though they
   significantly impact children's outcomes (Ackerman, 2004; Bellm and
   Whitebrook, 2004; Sylva, et al., 2004). In Malaysia, many early
   childhood educators lack qualifications and the resources to pursue them
   (Foong, et al., 2018). This study explored the experiences of seven
   early childhood educators in Malaysia with web-based informal
   professional development through interviews and media go-alongs,
   examining participants' use of and perception towards Web 2.0,
   particularly for self-directed and interactive learning.Results showed a
   burgeoning integration of Web 2.0 platforms in participants'
   professional learning. Participants emphasised the significant role of
   personal attitudes and workplace culture in encouraging learning and
   technology adoption and expressed interest in the development of Web 2.0
   communities of practice that support professional discourse and
   knowledge creation. These have the potential to strengthen professional
   identities and foster society-wide recognition of early childhood
   education as a profession.},

   Based on theories and practices},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the all-around
   development and mental health of students in education. Positive
   education, a rapidly developing ramification of positive psychology, has
   proved beneficial to students' learning and wellbeing. Meanwhile, online
   learning has quickly gained popularity due to the impact of COVID-19.
   However, there have been few reports discussing the relationship between
   positive education and online learning by combining theories and
   practices. To explore the connection between positive education and
   online learning, we provide a literature review for studies, mostly
   between 2010 and 2022, of theories and practices for both positive
   education and online learning. Next, we establish one-to-one links
   between the relevant theories and practices of online learning to each
   domain in the PERMA model of positive education, a theoretical framework
   including Positive emotion(P), Engagement(E), Relationship(R),
   Meaning(M), and Accomplishment(A). We aim to explore how to promote the
   development of positive education by applying the theoretical and
   practical advantages of online learning to the PERMA framework of
   positive education. This study aims to enrich the research perspectives
   of positive education and provide a reference for future research.},

Abstract = {Around 25 years ago, some researchers argued for moving towards
   innovative learning models characterised by being more personalised and
   where the students would have a more active role in deciding what to
   learn, when to learn and how to learn. Nowadays, there is a need for a
   flexible, efficient, universal and lifelong education. Lifelong learning
   is fully integrated into our society and, from the student point of
   view, it is very different from regular learning. Among these
   differences there is the maturity of students, the fact that the domains
   of interest are much broader, the way how learning occurs at different
   depths, the fact that the topics to study may be related to work, family
   and leisure, and that students have little availability due to their
   necessity to conciliate home, work, leisure and learning. Lifelong
   learning requires personalised models that adapt to students' needs and
   constraints, but lifelong learners keep suffering from models that are
   adapted neither to their necessities, nor to the needs of society. This
   paper reflects on the actual situation of lifelong learning, analyses
   some of the relevant literature and discusses the challenges to
   conceptualise, from a transdisciplinary point of view, innovative
   e-learning models that promote self-determination of students.},

Title = {Neo-Learning Methodology Applied to the Networked University},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION \& KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Number = {06},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Neo-learning was developed as a teaching and learning methodological
   platform for the networked university (NU) model in order to promote
   experiential and expansive learning for competence development and
   facilitate the transfer of learning into work practice. The objective of
   this paper is to analyse the neo-learning methodology as a
   methodological support for the NU model. To achieve this objective, a
   qualitative approach was chosen for exploratory and descriptive purposes
   through a narrative literature review and multiple case studies. This
   paper presents the main approaches and theories that underlie the
   network university (NU) and the neo-learning methodology. It also
   presents the guidelines of the NU, the neo-learning cycle, the
   mechanisms that facilitate the application of neo-learning in the NU,
   and the analysis of these mechanisms in three case studies. In
   conclusion, it is confirmed that the neo-learning methodology is aligned
   with the NU model and attends to the objective of subsidising the
   teaching and learning processes. Neo-learning has been validated in
   empirical research studies, both in academic and corporate universities
   (CUs), as well as in undergraduate courses, graduate programs and online
   courses, in presential or remote learning modalities.},

Title = {Cultivating Awareness: A Framework for Online Learning in Open Distance
   Learning},
Journal = {OPEN PRAXIS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-69},
Abstract = {Distance education institutions worldwide are adopting online learning
   to take advantage of its benefits. However, online learning is often
   seen as a mode of delivery that will work for any distance education
   institution in any context. The increased relevance of online learning
   during and after the COVID-19 pandemic has further exaggerated the
   adoption of online learning, which requires ongoing research on the
   actual use of online learning, and this study responds to this need.
   Therefore, this study aimed to determine how online learning is used in
   an open distance learning (ODL) context. A case study on the
   implementation of online learning was conducted at an ODL university in
   South Africa. Data were collected through open-ended questionnaires,
   interviews, and non-participant online observation. Participants were
   purposefully selected academics from various colleges in the university.
   Findings reveal that awareness of educational choices in the online
   environment appeared to be neglected. Based on the findings, the study
   presents a framework for online learning in ODL. It is built on the
   concept of awareness, and we argue that the integration of online
   learning should be carefully curated and planned with intentional
   institutional, lecturer, and student awareness. The principles of the
   theories of transactional distance, the community of inquiry, social
   constructivism and heutagogy should guide the operationalisation of each
   type of awareness presented in the framework.},

   in venture creation, with long-lasting consequences. So far, there is
   yet to be an ideal approach proposed in literature or observed in
   real-life for doing it. In this pedagogical innovation, three student
   teams with varying business ideas prompted ChatGPT using different
   keywords and levels of details, to get recommendations on essential team
   members, their roles and equity split. Each team presented their
   findings, and then the classroom engaged in a collective discussion. The
   students were surveyed afterwards to assess the reception and
   effectiveness of the intervention. Their feedback showed an overwhelming
   favoritism of ChatGPT, as a convenient and resourceful learning tool.
   The study establishes the potential value of ChatGPT as a heutagogical
   tool that supports student-centric entrepreneurial learning across
   educational institutions and the entrepreneurship ecosystem that extends
   to the venture creation process.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This scoping review aims to identify effective strategies
   that foster autonomous learning (AL) in prelicensure nursing courses and
   examine the associated domains across interrelated factors that
   positively influence learner autonomy (LA) development in nursing
   education. Design: A PRISMA-guided scoping review used four databases:
   Academic Search Premier, CINAHL Complete, ERIC, and MEDLINE. Eligible
   studies published between April 2013 and April 2023 were selected.
   Review methods: The review protocol followed the updated methodology
   guideline by Peters et al. (2020) to conduct rigorous member checking,
   and the PRISMA-scoping review checklist was used as a writing guide to
   generate an overview of the investigated topic. Result: Seven studies
   reviewed. Various teaching strategies promote AL, such as flipped
   classrooms, problembased learning, and small group learning in virtual
   and augmented realities. Eight domains across 19 factors were
   distinguished in promoting AL. Enhanced self-motivation is most crucial
   in developing LA. Conclusion: This review emphasizes the connection
   between effective teaching methods, autonomy-supportive settings, and
   students' perceptions of AL in nursing education. It offers new insights
   for nurse educators to promote LA. (c) 2023 Organization for Associate

Abstract = {The research explores the perceptions of five secondary school students
   with special education needs (SEN) about their participation in
   learning, group membership, and agency within an inclusive school in
   Macau SAR. This goal is achieved by using students' voices documented in
   open-ended interviews and is underpinned by the conceptual framework of
   heutagogy. The aim is to shed light on students' perceptions on school
   effectiveness in supporting their needs through successful participation
   and agentic possibilities. Findings showed that students were more prone
   to social rejection and being isolated or bullied than their peers. They
   were struggling to feel included or participate, their needs were only
   partially being met, and they had few opportunities to exert influence
   on their educational trajectories. Recommendations are provided to
   assist educators and schools in enhancing students with SEN to connect
   to the learning process and community, with the provision of appropriate
   learning adjustments and more active approaches to ensure their
   acceptance by mainstream students, including the formation of coaching
   peers to assist in developing social and academic skills under teacher's
   scaffolding practices. This study highlights the contribution of the
   heutagogical perspective to advance research on the participation and
   agency of students with SEN in mainstream schools.},

Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The `Learning Meta-Learning' dataset presented in this paper contains
   both categorical and continuous data of adult learners for 7
   meta-learning parameters: age, gender, degree of illusion of competence,
   sleep duration, chronotype, experience of the imposter phenomenon, and
   multiple intelligences. Convenience sampling and Simple Random Sampling
   methods are used to structure the anonymous online survey data
   collection voluntarily for LML dataset creation. The responses from the
   54 survey questionnaires contain raw data from 1021 current students
   from 11 universities in Bangladesh. The entire dataset is stored in an
   excel file and the entire questionnaire is accessible at
   (10.5281/zenodo.8112213)In this article mean and standard deviation for
   the participant's baseline attributes are given for scale parameters,
   and frequency and percentage are calculated for categorical parameters.
   Academic curriculum, courses as well as professional training materials
   can be reviewed and redesigned with a focus on the diversity of
   learners. How the designed courses will be learned by learners along
   with how they will be taught is a significant point for education in any
   discipline. As the survey questionnaires are set for adult learners and
   only current university students have participated in this survey, this
   dataset is appropriate for study andragogy and heutagogy but not
   pedagogy.},

Abstract = {Field education globally, has been highly disrupted by restrictions
   associated with COVID-19. This disruption has forced many students to
   engage with online learning. The current article presents a student-led
   co-operative inquiry exploring the experience of four social work
   students undertaking a remote research-based placement in regional
   Australia during a global pandemic. In this inquiry students' critically
   self-reflected on the strengths and challenges of remote research-based
   placements. Despite some initial reservations, the students' experience
   was positive overall. This article reports on four key themes that
   emerged from this inquiry: the translation of social work communication
   and relationship-building skills to online environments, the development
   of professional identity in a remote research-based placement, access to
   supervision in a remote context, and reflection on the experience of
   completing a research placement guided by the social work value of
   respect for persons. We conclude that undertaking a remote research
   placement helped forge students' appreciation for the role of research
   in social work, enhanced their communication and research skills, and
   strengthened students' sense of professional identity. These findings
   confirm remote research-based placements can offer relevant and
   effective placement opportunities that can inform social work
   field-education heutagogy as we move beyond the restrictions associated
   with the pandemic.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the philosophical concept of epistemic injustice and
   contends its significance and relevance to mental health nurse education
   and clinical practice. The term epistemic injustice may be unfamiliar to
   mental health nurses, yet the effects are readily visible in the
   dismissing, silencing, and doubting of service users' knowledge,
   testimony, and interpretation. Existing professional values and clinical
   standards lack depth and critical exploration pertaining to epistemology
   and associated ethical concerns. Despite central tenets of
   person-centred care and valuing the service users' voice, epistemic
   injustice continues to occur. Epistemic injustice cannot be summed up
   merely by asking nurses to listen to service users. This represents an
   oversimplification of epistemology, ignoring the complexities of social
   influence and knowledge exchanges. Epistemic injustice brings something
   new and innovative to the nursing curriculum and fits within the
   principles of heutagogy. It encourages deep reflexivity surrounding the
   ethical issues of power inequalities and intersectionality. Inclusion in
   mental health nursing education allows for the social and political
   powers of psychiatric diagnosis as a form of silencing and stigma to be
   examined. Practical application is made to mental health nursing
   education and practice with epistemological values and ethical reflexive
   prompts. These can be utilised by educators and lecturers for
   pre-registration mental health nurse education, post-registration, and
   continued professional development.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a study set in Wales where the Further Mathematics
   Support Programme Wales supports the provision of an advanced
   qualification in mathematics for 16- to 18-year-old students with
   courses delivered in reduced teaching time. The study aimed to
   understand how the students experienced the Further Mathematics (FM)
   courses which are delivered either face-to-face or online and, more
   generally, to negotiate a place of alternative forms of delivery in
   post-16 mathematics curriculum. Sixteen students, eight of whom studied
   through the online course, were interviewed; overall, although they
   found the course challenging both in terms of the content and relatively
   limited teaching time, they enjoyed it and appeared to perceive benefits
   from taking the course. Most volunteered `tips' about coping with the
   challenges of the course and the tips can be seen as strategies of
   self-regulation. Self-regulation strategies were reported more strongly
   by the students taking the course online than those attending
   face-to-face classes. In view of the evidence of technology creating new
   learning environments perceived as advantageous by students, it is
   hypothesized that introducing blended learning as part of post-16
   mathematics curriculum could be beneficial. Improving learner
   self-regulation is discussed as means of improving access to FM. Other
   findings included the importance of support from peers, parents and
   schools and gender differences.},

Abstract = {In the post-pandemic era, lifelong learning (LLL) emerged as the key to
   professional development and the core competency of all disciplines.
   Even globally, there is a dearth of evidence based bibliometric
   analysis, notably on LLL. This study addresses this gap by examining the
   data retrieved from the Elsevier Scopus database. A systematic search
   method was adopted to retrieve 1806 publications from 790 journals from
   1963 to 2022. The R package, Biblioshiny, was used for data analysis,
   including productivity/performance analysis, citation analysis, and
   collaboration network analysis of social structure. The findings showed
   that the number of publications has significantly increased over time. A
   large number of studies were published in 2022. Overall, 85 countries
   contributed to LLL. Among them, the United States was the most
   productive with 787 publications, and the United Kingdom was the country
   with 4731 citations. Learning was the trending topic, and skill
   development was an emerging theme in LLL. The results will aid the
   stakeholders in identifying largely unexplored areas of research that
   need more attention and funding. This study outlines not only the
   current scientific developments but also the potential future of LLL
   research. This study will also be used as a resource for researchers and
   teachers in LLL. Future research directions in this area of knowledge
   are also outlined.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the level of readiness for massive open online
   courses (MOOCs) of students in Oman. It compares the readiness of
   ordinary students in the Omani higher education institutions (HEIs) and
   those outside HEIs who took a MOOC from the larger Omani society and
   tests for the differences between their levels of readiness.
   Additionally, it tests for the best predictor for future participation
   in MOOCs. In this study, readiness is defined as the possession of three
   sets of skills: technological, metacognitive, and motivational. A
   sequential two-phase research approach was used by first collecting data
   from 428 students in different HEIs and then collecting the same data
   from 253 non-HEI students from the general public who were offered and
   took a MOOC specifically designed for this study. While high levels of
   the three sets of skills were found in both study samples, the MOOC
   students were found to have significantly higher motivational and
   metacognitive skills than the higher education students. In this study,
   binary regression results indicate that comfort with eLearning is the
   best predictor for future participation in MOOCs. Given the high student
   readiness for MOOCs in Oman in this study, some recommendations are
   provided for higher education institutions to benefit from the
   fast-moving MOOC phenomenon.},

Abstract = {There are known issues in authentic assessment design practices in
   digital education, which include the lack of freedom-of-choice, lack of
   focus on the multimodal nature of the digital process, and shortage of
   effective feedbacks. This study looks to identify an assessment design
   construct that overcomes these issues. Specifically, this study
   introduces an authentic assessment that combines gamification (G) with
   heutagogy (H) and multimodality (M) of assessments, building upon rich
   pool of multimodal data and learning analytics (A), known as GHMA. This
   is a skills oriented assessment approach, where learners determine their
   own goals and create individualized multimodal artefacts, receive
   cognitive challenge through cognitively complex tasks structured in
   gamified non-linear learning paths, while reflecting on personal growth
   through personalized feedback derived from learning analytics. This
   pilot research looks to: (i) establish validity of all elements within
   the assessment design, and (ii) identify if application of assessment
   design leads to improved learner satisfaction. Results showed positive
   validations of all key elements of the GHMA assessment model, as
   beneficial factors tied to positive learner satisfaction on assessment
   delivery. There existed statistically significant post-and pre-treatment
   differences between experimental and control group satisfaction levels,
   indicating positive receptivity of GHMA authentic assessment design in
   digital education.},

Title = {Digital Environments of Education 4.0 and complex thinking:
   Communicative Literacy to close the digital gender gap},

Abstract = {The gender digital divide (GDD) is a social phenomenon that denies
   citizens access to technologies, the internet, and the services
   associated with Education 4.0. Reducing this gap requires communicative
   literacy, which allows scaling knowledge, skills, and attitudes to
   create forms of media expression to interact effectively in virtual
   environments. Education 4.0 is a modern approach to education that
   focuses on preparing students to thrive in a digital and technological
   world. Additionally, Education 4.0 is based on three pedagogical
   principles, including Cyber pedagogy, Heutagogy, and Peeragogy, which
   emphasize the use of technology, self -determined learning, and
   collaboration, respectively. A mixed study was conducted with the
   participation of 124 Mexican students of technical -professional
   education. The study's objective was to analyze how they scaled their
   communicative literacy and complex thinking through a formative
   experience based on the pedagogical framework of Education 4.0 in
   digital environments called metaverses to bridge the GDD in Mexico.
   Quantitative results show only significant differences in systemic
   thinking (z = -2.113, p = 0.035 < 0.05), where women had a slightly
   higher mean ( M = 25.36) than men ( M = 25.11). Qualitative results
   support the finding of women excelling in systemic thinking, as
   participants expressed comments related to systemic thinking (90\%).
   This suggests that immersive digital environments can effectively
   enhance communicative literacy and complex thinking. Additionally, they
   can be spaces where both women and men achieve similar levels of digital
   literacy.},

Abstract = {Higher teacher education in European countries has undergone a
   remarkable transformation due to the constant convergence of educational
   systems and institutions of higher education in Western Europe. The aim
   of the article is to analyze the experience of using innovative
   technologies in higher pedagogical education in the European Union
   countries. Methods of analysis and synthesis, prediction, comparison,
   and abstraction were used to realize this main task. The results traced
   the main innovative technologies popular in European pedagogical
   universities. The effectiveness of interactive learning, modular
   education system, technology of level differentiation, methods of
   learning through research (use of the project method), E-learning, and
   deep use of digital platforms, which contributes to the formation of
   theoretical and practical knowledge, development of critical thinking
   and creative potential in higher education applicants is demonstrated.
   It is pointed out that e-learning based on university platforms allows
   users to actively participate in various international educational
   projects, creatively interact with other users and even create new
   content. Several European universities (from France, Germany, Austria,
   and other countries) have merged their e-learning platforms into one
   professional global service called web2.0. Important directions for the
   further development of teacher education will be heutagogy, peeragogy,
   or paragogy and cybergogy. The conclusions stressed the importance of
   further integration of digital innovative methods to teaching
   pedagogical disciplines.},

Month = {2024 AUG 1},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe teaching staff learns as a result of their daily teaching
   practice, and yet there is limited knowledge regarding the impact of
   extracurricular activities within the school, such as science clubs, on
   the professional growth of science teachers.PurposeThis study is
   proposed to deepen the understanding of how teachers perceive science
   clubs, what learning they obtain from them, and what factors contribute
   to promoting this learning.SampleFive experienced science teachers
   involved in coordinating school science clubs participated in the study.
   They were all experienced science teachers with some experience in
   running a science club.Design and methodsThe study may most accurately
   be described as a descriptive-qualitative study with a comprehensive
   scope. Data was obtained through semi-structured interviews. The
   collected information was analysed from a descriptive and interpretative
   perspective using techniques specific to content analysis.ResultsThe
   results show that teachers value science clubs as an opportunity to
   enhance both their content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, a space
   to reconsider what it means to be a science teacher, to get to know and
   connect more with their students, and to collaborate with other
   colleagues.ConclusionIt is concluded that the study provides evidence
   that the learning acquired in science club activities complements and
   expands the interviewed teachers' expertise and contributes to their
   professional development in all three dimensions: personal, social, and
   professional.},

Title = {Mobile learning frameworks and pedagogy: A systematic review},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article provides a systematic review of mobile learning frameworks
   that address issues of pedagogy published between 2011 and 2022. The
   objective of the review was to gain a clear picture of recent
   developments in mobile learning frameworks to provide an understanding
   of current directions in mobile learning pedagogy. Eighteen
   peer-reviewed journal articles that presented new mobile learning
   pedagogical frameworks were examined and evaluated based on the
   characteristics of each framework. The two main areas of analysis were
   the pedagogical approaches integrated into the frameworks and their
   definitions of mobile learning. We conclude that mobile learning
   frameworks have become more diverse over time, in many cases tending to
   focus on specific aspects of mobile learning rather than attempting to
   address overarching concepts. With respect to pedagogies and their
   underlying theories of learning, social constructivism, heutagogy,
   collaborative learning, experiential learning, inquiry-based learning,
   and student-centred learning were mentioned most frequently. However,
   although many frameworks make reference to pedagogy, there is limited
   analysis of how mobile learning pedagogy might be defined as distinct
   from other contexts of learning. The key characteristics of mobile
   learning, consistent through most of the reviewed frameworks, comprise
   the portability of mobile devices across multiple contexts,
   connectivity, and accessibility, as well as learner-centredness
   (including personalisation and self-regulation). One key aspect of
   identifying the uniqueness and future potential of mobile learning is
   the special affordances addressed by mobile learning theory. We conclude
   that this is an area where further research is required.},

Title = {Learning through relationships: The transformative learning experience
   of midwifery continuity of care for students: A qualitative study},

Abstract = {Background: Midwifery curricula in Australia incorporate `Continuity of
   care experiences' (CoCE) as an educa-tional strategy based on an
   assumption that midwifery students will learn skills and knowledge about
   woman -centred care that they may not learn in the typical fragmented
   care system. However, exactly what skills and knowledge they are
   expected to `learn' and how these can be assessed have never been
   specifically identified. Aim: To explore midwifery students' continuity
   of care learning experiences within pre-registration midwifery
   education.Methods: Focus groups were conducted with first, second and
   third year Bachelor of Midwifery students (n = 12), who were undertaking
   CoCE in rural and regional tertiary hospitals in NSW,
   Australia.Findings: The overarching theme, `Learning through
   relationships', was made up of three interrelated themes: Meeting women
   and making connections, Being known, and Understanding holistic
   care.Discussion: The findings from this study contribute to
   understanding the educational effects of CoCE. The CoCE relationship
   provided safety and freedom to learn which was seen as foundational for
   midwifery students' vision of their future practice and can be seen as a
   self-determined transformational approach to learning.Conclusion: This
   study adds insight into midwifery students' experience of CoCE, and
   demonstrates that trans -formative learning occurs through developing a
   relationship with both the woman and the midwife. For midwifery to
   develop as a profession and maintain its focus on woman-centredness, it
   is important that this aspect of midwifery education remains embedded
   within midwifery program philosophies and learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {TVET in Malaysia is geared toward providing quality education, training,
   and resources but it still needs to be strengthened and reformed toward
   producing a more quality and skilled workforce. This study aimed to
   procure feedback from TVET curriculum key-players' (automotive) on the
   integration of automotive case-based simulation (CBS) as TVET future
   learning strategies. Collective case-study research design was used with
   purposive sampling design which involved 5 curriculum key-players in
   vocational college and 16 automotive industries as study respondents. A
   set of questionnaires and interview protocols were used to gather
   quantitative and qualitative data. Intra-class correlation coefficient
   (ICC) was used to obtain an average measure agreement among raters.
   ATLAS.ti was also used through thematic analysis to produce models. The
   ICC showed high values of agreement for the process and structure of the
   CBS. The limitation of this research focused on one program (automotive
   technology) through the key-players' and industries' perspectives toward
   the implementation of CBS as a tool to enhance students' soft skills.
   The collation of both data showed the alignment between both parties
   against the CBS. The curriculum key-players agreed that CBS fulfilled
   its requirements as a tool to enrich TVET students' marketability
   skills, supported by the automotive industries' perspective which
   believed that using CBS would prepare TVET students' readiness to the
   workplace. Notably, the CBS provides an opportunity to stimulate
   thinking and learning preferences among students, in addition to being a
   learning tool for future TVET learning strategies that connect theory
   and practice in preparation for job training.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with utilization of selected social media where learning
   management system plays a comprehensive and stable role in the
   teaching/learning process in the university setting. The goal of the
   paper is to show the acceptance and a level of appropriateness of social
   media for study purposes perceived by students. Results from three
   consecutive studies form the backbone of the presented paper showing the
   trends in the acceptance of social media and satisfaction with them. Two
   areas are analysed: social media as a means of communication in the
   process of education and social media as a tool enabling students'
   revision and testing of study materials. This kind of research
   corresponds to the increased need to develop desired self-study skills
   in students, especially in the context of Covid19 experience. The first
   studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the
   identical set of examined social media and fit the comparison enabling
   to define the trend in students' satisfaction with social media for
   study purposes. The third study discussed in this paper was run during
   winter semester of 2021. The set of examined social media in the
   questionnaire was adapted to reflect the current social media scene.
   Experience with the abrupt shift to online platforms caused by global
   crisis has significantly affected the process of education exposing and
   endorsing the power of heutagogy. The situation prompted the need to
   emphasize the importance of autonomous education and ability to define
   educational needs and ways of achieving study goals.},

Title = {Enhancing learner affective engagement: The impact of instructor
   emotional expressions and vocal charisma in asynchronous video-based
   online learning},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 26},
Abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult
   learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become
   the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional
   delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread
   adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the
   inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of
   diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing
   the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our
   study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos
   from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845
   post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college
   students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical
   analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of
   instructors does not inherently affect students' affective engagement.
   The study revealed that learners' affective engagement is affected by
   distinct combinations of the instructor's facial and paraverbal
   expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary
   depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal
   attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners' affective
   engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our
   understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels
   academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor
   non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating
   emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but
   also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed
   techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective
   engagement.},

Abstract = {Universities play a crucial role in building the economic development
   capacity for their communities and regions. Their capacity building role
   is typically defined by contributions to the economic bottom line of the
   community and region where a university is located. This kind of
   capacity building may find itself in conflict with the long-term
   sustainable development needs of the region and with the responsibility
   of the university itself. Sustainable capacity building may require
   strategies that focus on the specific social, cultural, environmental,
   and physical context of a university's location beyond purely economic
   capacity goals. To achieve sustainable development outcomes,
   universities must advance an understanding of the context conditions
   within which they are located. At least three context systems are
   relevant to this view of development: the economy, society and culture,
   and the environment with its physical, biological, and ecological
   context conditions. Each of these context systems is characterized by
   distinct time frames, spatial configurations, rules, and success
   measures. A focus on economic development outcomes reflects only one
   subsystem's rules, behaviors, and success measures. By analyzing two
   case study examples from the United States and South Africa, we offer a
   framework for universities to advance sustainability objectives that
   correspond to their broader responsibilities. We argue that in order to
   meet these broader responsibilities, universities must first commit to
   giving expression to their own local context through the voices and
   lived realities of students and residents. Since universities build the
   brain trust of communities and regions around the world, they play an
   essential role in strengthening global sustainability goals by building
   the local capacity of their communities and regions.},

Title = {Adult Learning as Metamorphosis and Popular Education for Lesbian, Gay,

Abstract = {Critical events in Leonard Matlovich's life depict a reluctant activist
   for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/gender diverse, and queer+
   (LGBTQ+) equality. He served in the US military and subsequently came to
   personify the broad social challenges to the military's homophobic
   culture and recruitment practices. Matlovich's experience of a series of
   life metamorphoses made a difference beyond the individual. His example
   inspired multitudes of other concerned citizens in how to undertake
   their metamorphoses to challenge institutionalized homophobia.
   Breakthrough learning experiences in Matlovich's life are presented to
   explore and refine aspects of transformative learning theory by applying
   Jane Martin's metamorphosis model. The learning nexus between
   individuals and society is shown to be a dynamic interaction where both
   aspects of Matlovich's story and his influence are explored in the
   context of today's LGBTQ+ equality struggles. The article shows the
   conducive personal and societal conditions that enabled his various
   metamorphoses as whole-of-individual identity and sociocultural
   crossings toward transformational change. Additionally, the implications
   of Martin's educational metamorphosis are discussed. Adult educators are
   encouraged to emphasize learning located in the learner's life
   circumstances, exemplary case studies to inspire cultural crossings
   against injustice, and transformations as being about grasping in situ
   learning opportunities in the cross-influence between the whole person
   and their sociohistorical context. Matlovich's experiences show how
   relevant dimensions of Martin's theoretical approach, coupled with
   support from allies, can contribute to personal agency and can build a
   groundswell of learning needed to support activism for social justice
   movements.},

Title = {Building a risky-safe-space: Using refllective pedagogies and values to
   support writing development in work based learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},

Abstract = {The concepts of `graduateness' and graduate attributes became contested
   terrain before COVID-19 destabilised even the most assured of shared
   learning constructions. Indeed, for those of us immersed in the delivery
   of work-based learning (WBL), this has long been the case. Promotion of
   reductive notions of `skills' acquisition to comply neatly with an
   employability agenda holds little relevance for those students already
   engaged in full time careers, and with a wealth of professional
   experience. What can hold influence and interest, however, is the
   opportunity to engage in meaningful, agentic, professionally-aligned
   reflective practices as a scaffolded route to promoting self-awareness
   and developing confidence in mapping competences from the professional
   domain to the academic (and vice versa).This paper shares an account of
   taking an embedded approach to supporting the development of academic
   literacies amongst work-based learners in one UK HEI. In particular, it
   will consider the use of reflective pedagogical tools and values in
   supporting work-based learners to become confident and adaptable
   writers. Discussion considers how work-based pedagogies and approaches
   may have far-reaching relevance in a post-pandemic landscape, where
   reskilling and professional agility are likely to become more prolific
   aspects of education and work. Writing itself is framed as an integrated
   communication practice that encompasses literature retrieval, reading,
   evaluation, synthesis and articulation of argument. The paper will
   describe pre-pandemic academic support activities and share qualitative
   survey data in which students consider their confidence as both
   professional and academic writers. It concludes with consideration of
   how some of the approaches outlined may have relevance for the wider
   academic community.},

Title = {Psycho-social drivers influencing the adoption of asynchronous EdTech
   tools: a gendered perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2050-2074},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore a gendered perspective on
   how learners' intrinsic psychological motivators: valence,
   technology-innovativeness, self-development and self-efficacy as well as
   extrinsic social and institutional motivators, such as social norms and
   management commitment, collectively influence learners' behavioral
   intention to adopt asynchronous EdTech tools such as
   MOOCs.Design/methodology/approachA theoretical model was developed by
   integrating insights from social cognitive theory (SCT) and the
   technology acceptance model (TAM). Data were collected from 622 Indian
   college students across different academic levels who had enrolled in at
   least one MOOC. Data analysis was performed using covariance-based
   structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). The bootstrapping method using
   IBM AMOS 23.0 software was adopted further for moderation
   analysis.FindingsThe study found that while intrinsic drivers were
   positively associated with behavioral intention, extrinsic drivers had a
   limited influence. The results of the moderation analysis showed that
   gender significantly influenced the relationship between
   self-development and perceived usefulness as well as the relationship
   between valence and perceived usefulness. Our study's findings represent
   a significant contribution to theoretical advancements, indicating a
   notable shift in students' learning emphasis from social interactions to
   self-directed approaches. These results align closely with the
   principles of connectivism within the heutagogy theory framework,
   underscoring learners' responsibility in shaping their learning
   journey.Practical implicationsOur study findings hold significant
   practical implications for future applications. Based on our study's
   findings on the positive impact of self-development and self-efficacy,
   it is crucial to offer structured and interactive learning options for
   guided experiences. Integrating digital skills training into MOOC
   curricula can enhance engagement across diverse learner levels, given
   the significant predictive power of technology innovativeness.
   Furthermore, emphasizing the benefits of MOOC certifications, such as
   career advancement or academic recognition, can increase their appeal
   and perceived value, considering the significance of ``valence{''} as an
   influential factor.Originality/valueAsynchronous EdTech tools, notably
   MOOCs, have emerged as potent catalysts for social change, providing
   unparalleled accessibility, flexibility and avenues for lifelong
   learning. Our study pioneers an investigation into the impact of valence
   and technology innovativeness on learners' perceptions, significantly
   influencing their willingness to adopt MOOCs positively. By exploring
   nuanced sociological dynamics across diverse societies, our research
   underscores the necessity of customizing EdTech solutions to encompass
   diverse gender perspectives.},

Title = {Acceptance of Social Media for Study Purposes-A Longitudinal Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Background: Social media is a ubiquitous phenomenon that serves as a
   tool for communication, collaboration, and creativity. In the long term,
   it has an indispensable place in the field of education. The research
   paper discusses the use of certain social networking sites where
   learning management systems are extensively and consistently used in the
   teaching and learning process at universities. The rapid transition to
   online platforms had a tremendous impact on the educational process,
   exposing and promoting the effectiveness of heutagogy. The circumstances
   made it necessary to emphasize the value of self-directed learning and
   the capacity to identify educational requirements and strategies for
   reaching study objectives. This kind of research corresponds to the
   increased need to develop desired self-study skills in students.
   Objectives: The goal of the paper is to demonstrate how undergraduate
   students perceive the trends in acceptance and the degree of
   appropriateness of social media for academic purposes. Methods: Research
   on social media use in education was inspired by a review of the
   literature. The purpose of the questionnaire is to track awareness, use,
   general satisfaction, communication, testing, and revision. The set of
   social media examined in the survey (years 2021 and 2022) was modified
   to reflect the social media landscape at the time. This study compares
   the findings of four different studies. The outcomes are displayed in
   graphs. Results: Two areas are analyzed: social media as a means of
   communication in the process of education and social media as a tool
   enabling students' revision and testing of study materials. The first
   two studies, which were conducted in 2014 and 2019, are based on the
   same set of examined social media and fit the comparison, enabling to
   define the trend in students' perceived satisfaction with social media
   for study purposes. The third and fourth studies discussed in this paper
   were run during the winter semesters of 2021 and 2022. Conclusions: The
   most significant differences between 2021 and 2022 can be seen in
   Instagram, Twitch, and other platforms, where a substantial drop in
   satisfaction in the communication field can be seen. The biggest
   difference in revision and testing is found in Facebook, Twitch, and
   Teams, which are abandoning online teaching and learning after the
   COVID-19 event. Social media use for studying has significantly
   decreased, with noteworthy decreases in Wiki, Facebook, and video calls.},

Title = {Are undergraduate students studying smart? Insights into study
   strategies and habits across a programme of study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The approach that students take in their studies at university is
   critical not only for their academic success but is equally important in
   life-long learning for their career and professional development.
   Heutagogy is the study of self-determined learning and it is important
   that we appraise how students in higher education are developing their
   metacognitive awareness in how they learn and study effectively.
   Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research area that involves
   the scientific study of the human mind. It helps provide new knowledge
   in relation to areas such as memory, problem solving, knowledge transfer
   and understanding of complex topics. Cognitive science has demonstrated
   that re-testing oneself on material when learning, enhances and promotes
   greater retention of knowledge compared to re-reading the material.
   Learning that is distributed or spaced out over multiple study sessions
   also allows for greater retention of knowledge in the longer-term
   compared to `cramming' of information. To evaluate the use of effective
   study approaches and habits across three different levels of study in an
   undergraduate pharmacy programme, a survey study was employed. A
   paper-based survey was completed by first-, second- and third-year
   undergraduate pharmacy students (n=192) during class sessions. Although
   there was some evidence of metacognitive awareness such as using testing
   (retrieval practice) with practice problems; across all years,
   suboptimal study approaches such as rereading, copying notes and
   cramming were endorsed. A schedule of deadlines shaped the organisation
   of study and time management for most students. Self-testing was
   predominantly used to test learning rather than an approach used during
   learning. There was evidence of a difference between the cohorts in
   relation to decisions for prioritizing studying, returning to review
   course material and re-reading. The evidence from this study
   demonstrates that learners would require training on metacognitive
   awareness and effective study strategies to enable their self-determined
   learning capabilities to evolve. The linear progression through a
   programme of study alone will not achieve this. There is a need to embed
   and emphasize effective strategies for learning into curricula and for
   faculty to utilise metacognitive awareness in their teaching.
   Practitioner Notes
   1. Self-determined learning places an expectation that learners
   self-regulate and take responsibility for their learning. Student's
   independent study within a programme helps to consolidate learning.
   2. Study habits and preferences vary among individuals however there is
   clear evidence from cognitive science that not all study approaches are
   effective.
   3. Undergraduate students are using suboptimal study methods such as
   rereading notes, recopying notes and cramming information the night
   before a test. Self-testing was predominantly used to test learning
   rather than an approach used during learning.
   4. Students report that they are not using approaches taught to them by
   teachers. It has been shown that learners incorrectly predict suboptimal
   methods as superior to evidencebased approaches. We suggest that
   evidence-based study approaches are explicitly emphasised and embedded
   within courses.
   5. We recommend to senior managers with learning and teaching remits
   (Directors of Learning and Teaching, Pro Vice-Chancellors for Education
   and Student Experience) that faculty staff are informed about
   evidence-based learning approaches from cognitive science and increase
   metacognitive awareness in their teaching.},
